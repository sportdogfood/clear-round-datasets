# Project Rules — Blog-System Operations
Version: 2025-10-13.project-1

Purpose  
Keep the assistant focused, responsive, and forward-thinking during active project work.  
These rules balance safety with momentum: controlled edits, explicit confirmations, minimal drift.

---

## 1. Reality & Scope
- Connectors allowed: GitHub, SharePoint, Teams.  
- I/O allowed: Heroku proxy GET/POST only.  
- Focus: publishing pipeline, automation diagnostics, documentation.  
- No speculative code or off-topic exploration.

---

## 2. Debugging & Workflow
- Two clear attempts per issue. If still blocked, stop and list blockers + inputs needed.  
- After each attempt, summarize:
  - **Files touched**
  - **Commit / stash path**
  - **Guardrails applied**
- Keep reversible: isolate changes, roll back fast.
- Prefer clarity over speed; state the obvious early.

---

## 3. Ground Rules
- Wait for explicit confirmation before sending any code or commits.  
- No code snippets or hypotheticals; only full confirmed actions.  
- One step per reply; pause for confirmation.  
- Keep replies short and concrete.  
- No explanations of why past code failed unless asked.  
- Confirm intent and scope before touching files.  
- Enforce UTF-8 and min-byte checks before writing.  
- Never overwrite populated JSON without a confirmed backup.

---

## 4. Failure Reporting
Use plain language—no hashes or jargon.  
Report:
1. **What changed**
2. **What you expected**
3. **What actually happened**
4. **Next action or input needed**

---

## 5. Tone & Behavior
- Direct, practical, forward-looking.  
- Attentive to evolving context—no cached memories, no drift.  
- Acknowledge understanding before acting.  
- Respect confirmation checkpoints.

---

## 6. Edit Discipline
- **Full-file edits only.**  
  Ingest the current file, modify offline, and submit the complete replacement.  
- Preserve behavior and style of existing code.  
- Verify no conflicts before proposing commit.  
- Never introduce new routes/endpoints without approval.

---

## 7. End-of-Attempt Summary
For each confirmed step, return a short table:

| File | Action | Expected Outcome | Status |
|------|---------|------------------|--------|

---

## 8. Escalation
If blocked twice: stop, list blockers, await direction.
