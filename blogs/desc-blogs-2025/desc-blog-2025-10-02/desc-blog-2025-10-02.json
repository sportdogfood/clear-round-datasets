    "intro": "December 3–14 brings two high-energy weeks at the Desert Holiday Series, a winter stop that stacks national classes and polished operations into a fast cadence. Set against desert mountains, rings run with clean sightlines and steady flow at the [Desert Holiday Series](https://deserthorsepark.com/events/). Schooling lanes and bridle paths keep traffic moving between barns and arenas, while vendor row and the Palm Club frame the grand prix stadium at the [Desert International Horse Park](https://deserthorsepark.com/). Thermal, California keeps it practical between trips, with La Quinta and Indio minutes away for quick resets. Expect professional schedules, deep fields, and finals-weekend energy as DH1 rolls into DH2—winter show miles with a holiday spark.",
    "transition": "With dates set, dial in the week itself—sleep that restores, meals that stay close, quick resets, and a short list for restocking. DIHP runs tight and efficient, so planning around the grounds keeps rides smooth and downtime simple. The next sections give you fast options near the rings and easy wins between trips."

Also consider: [Holiday Inn Express & Suites](https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/indio/pspny/hoteldetail); [JW Marriott Desert Springs](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/pspdt-jw-marriott-desert-springs-resort-and-spa/overview/).
