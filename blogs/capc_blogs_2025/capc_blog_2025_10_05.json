    "intro": "Fall in Upper Marlboro brings the Capital Challenge Horse Show to a focused 12‑day run, September 24–October 5, with early‑week cadence tightening into finals energy. The [Capital Challenge Horse Show](https://www.pgparks.com/event_list/capital-challenge-horse-show) anchors the schedule, while rings and course builds keep the pace crisp. On site, Prince George’s Equestrian Center’s indoor Show Place Arena delivers clear sightlines with stadium seating and a dirt surface that reads well under lights; outdoor schooling and illuminated show rings extend the day. A modern wire‑frame horse sculpture and clean concourses add polish. Upper Marlboro stays practical and close‑range, keeping resets simple between trips. Plan to work from the grounds, then let the weekend carry the charge at [Prince George’s Equestrian Center](https://www.pgparks.com).",
    "transition": "With the week set, lock in short drives, predictable meals, and quick restocks so schooling trips and warm‑up‑ring windows stay on time. The next sections streamline sleep near PGEC, food close to the in‑gate, light local resets, and barn basics—from groceries and pharmacy to carts and a rental car."
