    "intro": "Fall in Maryland builds through two packed weeks at the [Capital Challenge Horse Show](https://www.pgparks.com/event_list/capital-challenge-horse-show), September 24–October 5, with early rounds setting pace and finals energy cresting on closing days. Inside the [Prince George Equestrian Center](https://www.pgparks.com), action runs between The Show Place Arena and outdoor schooling lanes, with clean sightlines and a steady ring-flow that keeps horses moving. Upper Marlboro sits minutes from Washington, D.C., so off-hours stay easy while vendors and seating cluster close to the main ring. Expect coast-to-coast talent and polished operations on the exhibitor side—this is a preeminent stop that draws the country’s best hunters, jumpers, and equitation riders. Arrive with a plan, then let the week gather speed around sharp trips and simple resets. Keep eyes up; we run the plan.",
    "transition": "With dates and rings in view, map the practicals next—sleep close, eat on schedule, reset smart, and restock quickly between classes. The picks below sit near the barns and schooling-ring, so mornings stay calm and evenings land on time while your board and orders-of-go drive the day."
