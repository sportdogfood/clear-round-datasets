    "intro": "The [Capital Challenge Horse Show](https://www.pgparks.com/event_list/capital-challenge-horse-show) runs September 24–October 5, 2025 at the [Prince George Equestrian Center](https://www.pgparks.com) in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. Expect polished hunter, equitation, and jumper moments inside The Show Place Arena with a smooth ring flow and efficient operations that keep days moving.\n\nUpper Marlboro sits close to the DMV hub, so downtime feels easy: suburban greenways, coffee in hand, and crisp early‑fall air on your walk between barn row and the jog strip. We keep the plan tight so you stay focused on warm‑up ring rhythm and vendor row resets between trips.",
    "outro": "Keep the week simple and sport‑forward. I can book lodging, map one barn dinner, and prep essentials so you walk into Capital Challenge Horse Show ready to ride."
