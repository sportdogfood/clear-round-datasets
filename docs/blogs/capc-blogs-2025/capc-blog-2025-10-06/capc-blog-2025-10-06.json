    "intro": "[Capital Challenge Horse Show](https://www.pgparks.com/event_list/capital-challenge-horse-show) runs September 24–October 5, 2025 at [Prince George Equestrian Center](https://www.pgparks.com) in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. A county-run complex connected to The Show Place Arena with a multi-ring footprint built for big fields. Expect an A-circuit pace and smooth ring-flow from schooling trips through finals; keep eyes on the warm-up ring, jog-strip, and vendor-row without losing time.

Upper Marlboro feels suburban and efficient, with quick hops to nearby retail clusters for off-barn resets. Early October brings mild air and crisp mornings—fresh footing underfoot and coffee steam in the cool. Competitors and crews move fast here; this guide trims errands so riders, trainers, and grooms stay focused.",
    "outro": "Keep the week simple and sport-forward. I can book lodging, map one barn dinner, and prep essentials so you walk into Capital Challenge Horse Show ready to ride.",
    "cta": "One message and it’s done. I’ll line up rooms, reservations, and essentials for a calm CAPC week."
