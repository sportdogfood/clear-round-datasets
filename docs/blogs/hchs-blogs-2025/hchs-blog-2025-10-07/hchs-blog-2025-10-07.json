    "intro": "The [Hampton Classic Horse Show](https://www.hamptonclassic.com/) runs August 23–30, 2026 at the [Hampton Classic Horse Show](https://www.hamptonclassic.com/) in Bridgehampton, NY. Expect FEI 5* and 2* show jumping with world‑class hunters, a polished showground feel, and a spectator‑friendly layout that keeps the grand‑prix focus clear. Warm‑up-ring flow rewards timing and course-walk prep for a smooth week.\n\nBridgehampton carries an easy coastal‑village vibe: mornings start crisp, afternoons soften with salt air, and evenings lean social along village streets. It’s late‑summer in the Hamptons, so plan resets between rides with a quick vendor-row stroll and jog-strip timing in mind—clean, rider‑first days built for a-circuit rhythm.",
    "outro": "Keep the week simple and sport-forward. I can book lodging, map one barn dinner, and prep essentials so you walk into Hampton Classic Horse Show ready to ride, with confirmations organized and adjustments handled quickly."
