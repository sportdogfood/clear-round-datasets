    "intro": "The [Hampton Classic Horse Show](https://www.hamptonclassic.com/horse-show) returns August 23–30, 2026, centered at the storied [Hampton Classic Horse Show](https://www.hamptonclassic.com/) grounds in Bridgehampton, NY. Expect a polished grand-prix atmosphere with boutique shopping and a lively vendor-village feel, plus classic grass-footing vibes around the main-ring. Keep eyes on ring-flow, warm-up-ring timing, and that fast jog-strip between classes.

Bridgehampton hums in late-summer light: salt air off the Atlantic, cedar shingles, and slow roll village mornings before the rings heat up. Beaches and harbor strolls reset energy between rounds.",
