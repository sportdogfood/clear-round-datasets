    "intro": "Winter sets the frame for two fast weeks at the Desert Holiday Series, December 3–14, split into DH1 and DH2 with momentum building through the second week. Under desert light, classes range from national to FEI, with CSI5* highlights and MLSJ team energy anchoring primetime. At the base of the mountains, Desert International Horse Park runs on clean sightlines, all‑weather footing, and wide schooling lanes that keep ring flow steady. Thermal, California stays practical and close, so time off course turns into short resets rather than drives. Get the schedule pulse on the [Desert Holiday Series](https://deserthorsepark.com/events/) page, then picture the grounds and arena layout at [Desert International Horse Park](https://deserthorsepark.com/). Keep eyes up; we run the plan.",
    "transition": "With timing and terrain in view, lock the support plan next. Sleep within a short drive, eat on a predictable loop, and stage barn basics so warm‑ups, walks, and schooling trips stay on time. The next sections compress choices around DIHP to protect mornings, stabilize evenings, and keep focus in the ring."
