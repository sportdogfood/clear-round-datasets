    "intro": "Spring returns to the desert with Desert Spring Series, March 18–29, a fast two‑week slate that resets the cadence after winter runs. On the official [Desert Spring Series](https://deserthorsepark.com/events/) calendar, early‑week qualifiers build into weekend finales, while polished national classes keep pace in parallel rings. At [Desert International Horse Park](https://deserthorsepark.com/), palm‑lined arenas sit against purple mountain backdrops, with clean sightlines, all‑weather footing, and wide bridle paths that keep traffic flowing between barns and schooling. Thermal, CA stays practical and close‑in so energy stays on the board, not the drive. Save your spring focus for the ring here.",
    "transition": "With dates locked and rings in view, dial in the week around DIHP: where you’ll sleep for quiet resets, eat on schedule between trips, and restock the barn without detours. The next sections keep drives short, choices simple, and your focus fixed on the rounds that matter."
