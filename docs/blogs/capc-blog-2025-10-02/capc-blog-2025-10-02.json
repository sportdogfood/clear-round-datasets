    "intro": "Capital Challenge Horse Show runs September 24–October 5, 2025, bringing A-circuit hunters, equitation, and jumpers to Prince George Equestrian Center in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. Early fall here feels crisp and green suburban, with calm mornings and soft light—good headspace for course-walks. The venue is a multi-ring complex with ample stabling and easy suburban access. Keep eyes on the warm-up ring and jog strip, then reset off-ring without losing rhythm. Arrive organized. We set the week so you stay ring-focused and fresh when it counts at Capital Challenge Horse Show.",
    "outro": "Keep the week simple and sport-forward. I can book lodging, map one barn dinner, and prep essentials so you walk into Capital Challenge Horse Show ready to ride."
