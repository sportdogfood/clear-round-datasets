      "intro": "The World Equestrian Center (WEC) at once moves into its spring sweep, is a massive complex with multiple arenas, broad concourses, and stable barn rows. Stadium arenas and warm up fields fill with riders and trainers running drills and sporting classes. The spaces are bright and organized, with plenty of room and cooling areas that keep air and light moving. Wec is not just a venue, but a frame that captures the spirit of spring competition in Ocala.",
      "transition": "Bereneath the structures and the events, the venue feels like a small city under load. Once the days are over, the grounds settle back to a quieter rhythm where visitors and competitors can refresh and reset for the week ahead."
