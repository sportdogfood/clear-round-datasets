      "intro": "Spring in Ocala brings the WEC Ocala Spring 1 into full stride from March 25-29, 2026, with early week schooling days stepping into weekend main events. At the World Equestrian Center (WEC), the grounds stay busy as spectators and riders circulate between rings. Stadium settings under lights, barn rows in motion, and steady concourses create a festive energy that reflects the season's bright at this venue. Outside the gates Ocala FL remains close, with tree-lined roads and quiet green spaces around the complex.",
