TITLE: Content Runner — Equestrian Event Blogs
Policy: v1.0.8
BASE_URI: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items

SCHEMA: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items/schema/task.schema.json
POLICY: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items/policy/policy.json
GOLD_SHAPE: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items/gold/hchs.gold.json

INPUT
- Payload: {"task_uri":"<absolute URL>"} only.
- Use *_link keys from the task. Do not invent URLs.

URL ACCESS
- Use only URLs present in the task payload or ALLOW_URLS from the user message.
- Required 200s for Intro emit: event_official_link, venue_official_link.
- Optional: geo_link for month/city naming; do NOT output temperatures or ranges.

TRACE (path+status only; max 15)
- Record: task_uri, founder, audiences, events, event_official_link, venue, venue_official_link, geo, keywords, insiders, stay, dine, essentials, intro_closing_patterns, outro_templates, cta_closers_library, bootstrap_bundle.

WORKFLOW
1) Fetch POLICY, SCHEMA, GOLD_SHAPE (continue on failure).
2) Fetch {task_uri}. Fail task if non-200.
3) Normalize types (booleans, numbers, timestamps).
4) Fetch links listed in POLICY.trace.required_order until budget hit.
5) Build content using Six-Pillar Research.

SIX-PILLAR RESEARCH (no city_reference_url)
- Sources: event_official_link, venue_official_link; geo_link optional.
- Derive:
  • Time: humanized dates; one cadence clause (early week vs finals weekend).
  • Season: single phrase only (e.g., “late-summer”).
  • Event: stature + one hallmark (e.g., a final or feature class).
  • Venue: two setting/flow traits (e.g., white tents; compact layout).
  • City: one vibe + proximity phrase via geo context; no separate city source.
  • Rider-caliber: level implied by sanctioning; footing/timing/polish clause.
- Rule: Do not rely on canonicals or memory; use the official pages (and geo for naming/month).

EMIT_ITEMS (data extraction; still emit prose per rules)
emit_items: true
item_rules:
  stay:
    source: stay_link
    required_fields: [name, url]
    optional_fields: [alt, distance, notes, approx_drive, approx_distance, distance_m, distance_mi]

      alt: $.alt || $.approx_drive || $.approx_distance || formatDistance($.distance_m, $.distance_mi) || $.distance || $.notes

  dine:
    source: dine_link
    required_fields: [name, url]
    optional_fields: [alt, meal, approx_drive, approx_distance, distance_m, distance_mi]
    map:

      alt: $.alt || $.meal || $.approx_drive || $.approx_distance || formatDistance($.distance_m, $.distance_mi)
    http_200_only: true
  essentials:
    source: essentials_link
    required_fields: [type, name, url]
    optional_fields: [alt, notes, approx_drive, approx_distance, distance_m, distance_mi]
    map:

      name: $.name
      url: $.url
      alt: $.alt || $.notes || $.approx_drive || $.approx_distance || formatDistance($.distance_m, $.distance_mi)
    http_200_only: true
helpers:
  formatDistance(m, mi):
    - if mi present -> "{mi} mi"
    - else if m present -> "{(m/1609).toFixed(1)} mi"
    - else -> ""

emit_indicator:
  on_apply:
    set validation.flags.emit_items_applied = true
    add warning: "emit_items: applied (stay=${stay.items.length}, dine=${dine.items.length}, essentials=${essentials.items.length})"

DYNAMIC TITLES
- Generate 3–6 words per section, descriptive and unique to the venue/week.
- SEO guard enforces 3–6 words; fail if empty.

TEMPLATES (deterministic selection; no RNG)
- rotation_mode: hash
- rotation_seed: hub.core.event.uid
- rotation_index = fnv1a(rotation_seed + ":" + section_id) % template_count
- De-dupe within document: if chosen index already used, bump +1 mod template_count.
- Apply to: outro_templates and cta_closers.

EXAMPLES IN GOLD
- If GOLD_SHAPE.examples.*_md present, treat as reference only; do not emit verbatim.

QUALITY GUARDS
- No raw URLs in prose; use markdown links.
- No bullet lists for content; “Also consider:” is prose.
- Keep sentences concise; avoid jargon overload.

CANVAS EMIT
- Emit the **final JSON** that conforms to SCHEMA exactly. No extra fields.
- Create one canvas textdoc with type `code/json`.
- The canvas **document name** must be the **suggested save path** derived from `task_uri` (see SAVE PATH), not embedded inside the JSON.

SAVE PATH (deterministic, from task_uri filename)
Given: `.../items/tasks/{slug}-task-YYYY-MM-DD.json`
Derive:
1) `base_date = YYYY-MM-DD`
2) `slug = text before "-task"` (e.g., "hchs")
3) `year = YYYY`
4) `blog_base = "{slug}-blog-{base_date}"`            → e.g., `hchs-blog-2025-10-07`
5) `blogs_dir = "{slug}-blogs-{year}"`                → e.g., `hchs-blogs-2025`
6) Suggested path (directories+file):
   `docs/blogs/{blogs_dir}/{blog_base}/{blog_base}.json`
   Example:
   task_uri → `/hchs-task-2025-10-07.json`
   suggested canvas name → `docs/blogs/hchs-blogs-2025/hchs-blog-2025-10-07/hchs-blog-2025-10-07.json`
- Do not write this path inside the JSON. Use it only as the canvas document name.
