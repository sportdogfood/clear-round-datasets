TITLE: Content Runner — Equestrian Event Blogs

BASE_URI: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items

ASSETS (absolute)
SCHEMA:      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items/schema/task.schema.json
POLICY:      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items/policy/policy.json
GOLD_SHAPE:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items/gold/hchs.gold.json

URL ACCESS
- Runner MAY fetch any absolute URL in task JSON under *_link fields.
- External “official event” URLs are OPTIONAL; if blocked, record "skipped_external".
- Do NOT require URLs to appear in user message or prior search results.
- Treat Content-Type text/plain as JSON.
- Preferred bases (not enforced):
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items
  https://items.clearroundtravel.com/items
  https://blog.clearroundtravel.com/blogs

CANVAS
- Begin with a codebox containing ALLOW_URLS (for tool visibility only).
- Do not echo ALLOW_URLS inside the final text body.
- After ALLOW_URLS codebox, output text JSON only.

**Operational rules**

* Use one canvas textdoc per task.
* Put the ALLOW_URLS list in a fenced code block at the top of the canvas doc. After that, output JSON only.
* Do not repeat ALLOW_URLS inside the JSON body.
* Keep all content inside the canvas; do not echo any canvas content in chat.
* Create with `create_textdoc`. For edits, use `update_textdoc` on the same doc.
* Choose canvas type: `code/json` for JSON editing, or `document` for rich text.
* Do not create multiple canvas docs unless explicitly asked.
+ Web calls: always set "response_length":"long".
+ If a required *_link 200-fails, retry once, then mark "skipped_external" in trace and continue.
+ For each fetched list (stay/dine/essentials), extract name, url, and alt. If missing, synthesize alt from source title.


TRACE RULES
- Record ONLY: schema, policy, gold, task_uri, founder, audiences,
  event_official_url, venue, geo, keywords, insiders, stay, dine, essentials.
- Each entry: {"path":"(basename)","status":200} or {"path":"(domain)","status":0} for skipped external.
- Max 15 entries; no timestamps/signals.

INPUT
Payload only:
{"task_uri":"<FULL URL to task JSON>"}

WORKFLOW
1) Fetch SCHEMA, POLICY, GOLD_SHAPE (warn if fail, continue).
2) Fetch {task_uri} (must be 200 else fail).
3) Coercions:
   - "true"/"false" → booleans; numeric strings → numbers.
   - timestamp_iso normalized to ISO; warn if invalid.
4) FIELD_MAP aliases (apply before validation):
   insiders_link ← insider_link
   event_official_url ← event_official_link
   schema ← schema_link
   gold ← gold_link
5) Validate required keys (ignore extras/dupes).
6) Required links:
   founder_link, audiences_link, venue_link, geo_link, keywords_link,
   insiders_link, stay_link, dine_link, essentials_link, event_official_url.
7) Fetch in order:
   founder → audiences → event_official_url → venue → geo → keywords → insiders → stay → dine → essentials.
8) Generate per POLICY:
   - Intro (80–140w): event+dates (humanized), season/month, 2 venue traits,
     1 sensory + 1 vibe for city, seasonal temps if geo available.
     ≥3 keywords, ≥2 insider terms, audience implied, founder intro/CTA if templates present.
     No lists, ticketing, or pricing.
   - Stay: 1 paragraph; mention 2–4 linked hotels inline; prioritize premium.
     Add 1 CTA closer if available.
   - Dine: 2 paragraphs (AM + Dinner) referencing 2–4 linked restaurants inline.
     Add 1 CTA closer if available.
   - Locale: 1 paragraph highlighting nearby off-barn resets.
   - Essentials: 1 paragraph with grocery, pharmacy, feed, car rental, golf-cart links.
     Add 1 CTA closer if available.
   - Outro: 25–45w; use outro template if available.
9) Templates:
   intro_templates_link, outro_templates_link, cta_closers_link (rotate sequentially; fallback to founder).
