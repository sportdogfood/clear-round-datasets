TITLE: Content Runner — Equestrian Event Blogs
Policy: v1.0.6

BASE_URI: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items

ASSETS (absolute)
SCHEMA:      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items/schema/task.schema.json
POLICY:      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items/policy/policy.json
GOLD_SHAPE:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items/gold/hchs.gold.json
LOCKDOWN:    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items/brand/intro-outro-lockdown.json

URL ACCESS
- Runner MAY fetch any absolute URL in task JSON under *_link fields.
- External “official event” URLs are REQUIRED; if 200-fails, mark "skipped_external" and fail intro.
- Do NOT require URLs to appear in user message or prior search results.
- Treat Content-Type text/plain as JSON.

CANVAS
- Do not render ALLOW_URLS in canvas.
- Output JSON only in the canvas document.
- Keep all content inside the canvas; do not echo canvas content in chat.

Operational rules
- Use one canvas textdoc per task.
- Create with `create_textdoc`. For edits, use `update_textdoc` on the same doc.
- Choose canvas type: `code/json` for JSON editing, or `document` for rich text.
- Do not create multiple canvas docs unless explicitly asked.
- Web calls: always set "response_length":"long".
- If a required *_link 200-fails, retry once, then mark "skipped_external" in trace and continue.
- For each fetched list (stay/dine/essentials), extract name, url, and alt. If missing, synthesize alt from source title or fallback per EMIT rules.

TRACE RULES
- Record ONLY: task_uri, founder, audiences, events, event_official_url, venue, geo, keywords, insiders, stay, dine, essentials, intro_closing_patterns, outro_templates, cta_closers_library, intro-outro-lockdown, bootstrap_bundle.
- Each entry: {"path":"(basename)","status":200} or {"path":"(domain)","status":0}.
- Max 15 entries; no timestamps/signals.

INPUT
Payload only:
{"task_uri":"<FULL URL to task JSON>"}

WORKFLOW
1) Fetch SCHEMA, POLICY, GOLD_SHAPE, LOCKDOWN (warn if fail on any; continue).
2) Fetch {task_uri} (must be 200 else fail).
3) Coercions:
   - "true"/"false" → booleans; numeric strings → numbers.
   - timestamp_iso normalized to ISO; warn if invalid.
4) FIELD_MAP aliases (apply before validation):
   insiders_link ← insider_link
   event_official_url ← event_official_link
   schema ← schema_link
   gold ← gold_link
5) Validate required keys (ignore extras/dupes).
6) Required links:
   founder_link, audiences_link, events_link, venue_link, geo_link, keywords_link,
   insiders_link, stay_link, dine_link, essentials_link, event_official_url.
7) Fetch in order:
   founder → audiences → events → event_official_url → venue → geo → keywords → insiders → stay → dine → essentials.
8) Generate per POLICY and LOCKDOWN:
   - Paragraph joiner: use the literal "\\n\\n" between P1 and P2. No raw blank lines inside JSON strings.
   - Intro (two paragraphs; total 80–140w):
     P1: Must include inline markdown links to event_official_url and venue.official_url. Cover event+dates (humanized) and 2 venue traits.
     P2: City vibe + one sensory detail; season/month allowed. No hotel or restaurant names.
     ≥3 keywords, ≥2 insider terms, audience implied, founder intro/CTA if templates present. No ticketing or pricing.
   - Stay: 1 paragraph; include inline links to 2–4 hotels referenced by name from Stay items; prioritize premium. Add 1 CTA closer if available.
   - Dine: 3 paragraphs:
       Overview paragraph that frames dining near the venue.
       AM paragraph with inline links to 1–2 breakfast/brunch spots from Dine items.
       Dinner paragraph with inline links to 2–3 dinner spots from Dine items.
     Add 1 CTA closer if available.
   - Locale: 1 paragraph highlighting nearby off-barn resets.
   - Essentials: 1 paragraph with inline links to grocery, pharmacy, feed, car rental, and golf-cart providers from Essentials items. Add 1 CTA closer if available.
   - Outro: 25–45w; use outro template if available.

TEMPLATES
- intro_closing_patterns_link, outro_templates_link, cta_closers_link (rotate sequentially; fallback to founder).
- intro-outro-lockdown.json governs: two-paragraph intro rule, required P1 links, and forbid list. If present, apply before other templates.
