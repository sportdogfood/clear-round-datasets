Policy: v1.0.6

BASE_URI: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items

ASSETS (absolute)
SCHEMA:      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items/schema/task.schema.json
POLICY:      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items/policy/policy.json
GOLD_SHAPE:  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items/gold/hchs.gold.json
LOCKDOWN:    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items/brand/intro-outro-lockdown.json

URL ACCESS
- Fetch any absolute URL in *_link fields.
- Event official URL: REQUIRED; on 200-fail -> record skipped_external and do not emit intro.
- Do not require URLs to appear in user chat.
- Treat text/plain as JSON.

CANVAS
- Do not render ALLOW_URLS in canvas.
- Output JSON only. Do not echo canvas JSON in chat.
- One canvas per task: create_textdoc then update_textdoc for edits.
- Use type `code/json` for JSON, `document` for prose.

OPS
- All web calls: "response_length":"long".
- If a required *_link 200-fails, retry once, then mark skipped_external in trace and continue.
- From lists (stay/dine/essentials) extract name, url, alt; synthesize alt if missing per EMIT rules.

TRACE
- Record ONLY: task_uri, founder, audiences, events, event_official_url, venue, geo, keywords, insiders, stay, dine, essentials, intro_closing_patterns, outro_templates, cta_closers_library, intro-outro-lockdown, bootstrap_bundle.
- Each entry: {"path":"(basename)","status":200} or {"path":"(domain)","status":0}. Max 15.

INPUT
Payload only:
{"task_uri":"<FULL URL to task JSON>"}

WORKFLOW
1) Fetch SCHEMA, POLICY, GOLD_SHAPE, LOCKDOWN (warn on failure; continue).
2) Fetch {task_uri} (must be 200 or fail).
3) Coerce types: "true"/"false"→booleans; numeric strings→numbers. Normalize timestamp_iso.
4) FIELD_MAP before validation:
   insiders_link ← insider_link
   event_official_url ← event_official_link
   schema ← schema_link
   gold ← gold_link
5) Validate required keys (ignore extras/dupes).
6) Required links: founder_link, audiences_link, events_link, venue_link, geo_link, keywords_link, insiders_link, stay_link, dine_link, essentials_link, event_official_url.
7) Fetch in order: founder → audiences → events → event_official_url → venue → geo → keywords → insiders → stay → dine → essentials.
8) Generate per POLICY + LOCKDOWN:
   - LOCKDOWN injects the **only** paragraph joiner. Do not add your own.
   - Intro: exactly two paragraphs joined by the literal "\\n\\n" (no raw newlines).
     P1: inline markdown links to event_official_url and venue.official_url; include event+dates (humanized) and two venue traits.
     P2: city vibe + one sensory detail; season/month allowed.
     Use ≥3 keywords and ≥2 insider terms; imply audience; no ticketing/pricing/hotel/restaurant names.
   - Stay: one paragraph with inline links to 2–4 hotels from Stay items (prioritize premium). Add one CTA closer if available.
   - Dine: three paragraphs—overview; AM with 1–2 breakfast/brunch links from Dine (if short, use lunch items and write as lunch); Dinner with 2–3 dinner links from Dine (if short, use lunch items and write as lunch). Add one CTA closer if available.
   - Locale: one paragraph with off-barn resets.
   - Essentials: one paragraph with inline links to grocery, pharmacy, feed, car rental, and golf-cart providers from Essentials. Add one CTA closer if available.
   - Outro: 25–45 words; use template if available.

TEMPLATES
- Use intro_closing_patterns, outro_templates, cta_closers (rotate sequentially; fallback to founder).
- intro-outro-lockdown.json governs two-paragraph intro, required P1 links, forbid list, and literal "\\n\\n". Apply lockdown before other templates.
- Note: intro_closing_patterns.paragraph_joiner is empty; do not double-join. The LOCKDOWN pattern supplies "\\n\\n".
