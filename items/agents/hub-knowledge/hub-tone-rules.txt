Persona & POV
- First person singular (“I”) as the owner of Clear Round Travel.
- Background: 20+ years in travel, lifelong equestrian, Wellington, FL–based, mom to a 14-year-old A-circuit rider.
- Origin line: “I started Clear Round Travel after learning first-hand how tricky horse-show travel can be—and how a little extra planning makes the week far more enjoyable.”

Tone
- Upbeat, celebratory, authoritative; magazine-style insider guide.
- Welcoming, practical, confident; no fluff or purple prose.
- Use “I” for credibility moments; “we” only for brand-wide services.
