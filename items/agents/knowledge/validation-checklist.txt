# Clear Round Travel - Kernel & Agents
# Version: v1
# Last updated: 2025-09-01

Purpose
-------
Single-source checklist for validating tasks and writes. Applies to Humans (Airtable/PowerShell),
the Agent (kernel tasks), and Codex (PRs). Use before any COMMIT.

Applies to
----------
- ADD (create new file under /index/** or /items/**)
- UPDATE (modify existing file)
- Non-write domains (research/create/query/reminders) - output-only sanity

Prerequisites (environment)
---------------------------
- dir-map.json (v2) exists at items/agents/dir-map.json with {entities, normalizers, content}
- Heroku ALLOW_DIRS covers all prefixes marked "include = y" in dir-map.json (verify via heroku config:get)
- manifest-contract.txt present; write paths must fall under write_allowlist/ALLOW_DIRS

General (all tasks, before PREVIEW)
-----------------------------------
[ ] Input validated against task input_schema (types, required, enums)
[ ] Normalize booleans to "y"/"n"; keys are lower_snake_case
[ ] Derive stable fields (UIDs, slugs, normalized dates/links) per naming-policy.txt
[ ] HTTPS only for links (official_link and external URLs); strip non-essential tracking params
[ ] Dates in YYYY-MM-DD; timestamps UTC ISO 8601 (Z)

ADD - creating a new file (PREVIEW gate)
----------------------------------------
[ ] Target path computed from naming-policy + dir-map.json (no hardcoded paths)
[ ] Path begins with an ALLOW_DIRS prefix (allowlist check)
[ ] File does NOT already exist (unless explicitly allowed by task upsert mode)
[ ] Payload is complete final file content (not a patch)
[ ] Keys sorted deterministically; no undefined or null-only scaffolding unless schema allows
[ ] Required fields present (event/venue/source-specific as applicable)
[ ] Relations resolved to *_uid; if not resolvable, mark explicit deferrals in PREVIEW notes
[ ] Link and date sanity (https_only, plausible date ranges)
[ ] Hub vs leg sanity:
    - Legs sit fully inside the hub date window.
    - No overlapping leg date ranges.
    - Week or leg labels are consistent (for example "Week 1"..."Week N").
[ ] PREVIEW includes:
    - path
    - payload (full)
    - notes (assumptions, deferrals)
    - lane hint (green/yellow/red) per permissions-policy.txt
STOP. Do not write until Human issues COMMIT.

UPDATE - editing an existing file (PREVIEW gate)
------------------------------------------------
[ ] Target path computed (as above) and file exists
[ ] Path within ALLOW_DIRS (allowlist check)
[ ] Load current file; ensure valid JSON
[ ] Apply surgical changes only to requested fields
[ ] Sensitive fields changed? (dates, ratings, divisions, airports, relations, path) -> mark as RED lane
[ ] Safe fields only? (display_name, official_link, labels, minor description) -> likely YELLOW lane
[ ] Payload is complete post-change file content
[ ] Link and date sanity (https_only, plausible date ranges)
[ ] Hub vs leg sanity:
    - Legs sit fully inside the hub date window.
    - No overlapping leg date ranges.
    - Week or leg labels are consistent (for example "Week 1"..."Week N").
[ ] Include BEFORE/AFTER summary:
    - changed_fields (list)
    - before_after sample of key fields
    - diff_summary (lines_added/removed)
[ ] PREVIEW includes:
    - path
    - payload (full)
    - before_after and diff_summary
    - lane hint (green/yellow/red) per permissions-policy.txt
STOP. Do not write until Human issues COMMIT.

COMMIT (after PREVIEW approval)
-------------------------------
[ ] Commit body: { path, json: payload, message }
[ ] Message is clear ("feat/fix/chore: <what> - <why>"); include actor (human/agent/codex)
[ ] Default mode PR (Agent/Codex). Human may choose direct commit only for GREEN items
[ ] Proxy enforces ALLOW_DIRS/write_allowlist; reject on violation

Conflict handling (all writers)
-------------------------------
[ ] If target changed since PREVIEW, fail safe (no write)
[ ] Re-fetch current file, re-derive changes, present new PREVIEW
[ ] Do not force-merge in Agent flow

Non-write domains (sanity)
--------------------------
research/
[ ] facts-only JSON; include minimal source hints (domain names, retrieved_at if relevant)

create/
[ ] content JSON or Markdown per task schema; no write

query/
[ ] counts/lists/refs; no write

reminders/
[ ] schedule JSON (RRULE or structured times); no write

Naming and path rules (enforced)
--------------------------------
[ ] UIDs and slugs per naming-policy (lowercase, hyphen slugs; stable)
[ ] File paths match the patterns and registry (dir-map.json); no ad-hoc trees
[ ] No path moves or renames without RED-lane approval

Quality and size caps
---------------------
[ ] JSON is minified/pretty per repo norm; no trailing commas
[ ] Large diffs: more than 50 lines (data) or more than 200 lines (hygiene) -> escalate lane (see permissions-policy)
[ ] Multi-file: more than 10 files in one PR -> escalate lane

Lane classification (reference)
-------------------------------
GREEN (auto-commit allowed): docs and scaffolds only; no dataset semantics
YELLOW (PR required): task edits, dataset mechanics (non-semantic), small safe data updates
RED (explicit approval): dates/ratings/divisions/airports/relations, deletes/renames/moves, bulk edits, schema changes

Rollback plan (every PR/change)
-------------------------------
[ ] PR description includes how to revert (PR number or previous hash)
[ ] For direct commits, note the prior SHA in message or ticket

Negative checks (quick)
-----------------------
[ ] Empty path -> clear error
[ ] Path outside ALLOW_DIRS or write_allowlist -> allowlist_denied
[ ] Invalid schema or enum -> bad_input
[ ] Rule failure (https_only, date window, relation unresolved without deferral) -> validation_failed
[ ] Starter not found -> not_enabled
[ ] Head mismatch -> conflict
[ ] Empty or duplicate UID -> validation_failed

Error codes (see error-codes.txt for remediation)
-------------------------------------------------
not_enabled
bad_input
validation_failed
allowlist_denied
conflict
server_error
upstream_error

Sign-off (prior to merge)
-------------------------
[ ] PREVIEW matched what was committed
[ ] Lane and any rails hit were called out in the PR
[ ] Commit or PR message is descriptive; actor and scope are clear
[ ] If RED: human explicit approval recorded

Change control for this checklist
---------------------------------
- Updates are YELLOW (PR required).
- Any relaxation of checks must be called out in the PR description.
