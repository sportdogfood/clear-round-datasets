VENUES — OPERATOR CONTRACT (v1.0)

SCOPE & TRUTH
- Facts-only. Operator supplies HINTS; system confirms official name/link from the site.
- UID must end with -venue. Filename equals UID: items/index/venues/{venue_uid}.json

REQUIRED INPUTS (Task: add_venue)
- link            : HTTPS to official or candidate page (hint)
- name            : candidate title (hint)
- city_uid        : required
- state_uid       : required
- country_uid     : required
- aka             : optional (pipe-delimited), used as hints

WHAT THE SYSTEM CONFIRMS / DERIVES
- venue_official_link : canonical HTTPS on same domain (follow redirects)
- venue_official_name : confirmed from official page (fallback to hint if not contradicted)
- venue_display_name  : copy of official name
- venue_uid           : slug(official name) with -venue suffix; on collision append -{city stem}
- source_uids         : domain slug of official link
- keywords            : deterministic set from official name + aka + city_uid + state_uid (lowercased, deduped, capped)
- venue_city/state    : friendly names from normalizers (convenience only)
- created_date, last_updated
- Geo parse (no geocoder): if a Google Maps pin exists on official pages, parse lat/long from the URL; store as strings.

GUARDS / STOPS
- Hard-stop if: link not HTTPS; link not official; city/state/country normalizers missing.
- Duplicates: choose first ranked candidate, set git_status=needs_review, append facts-only note listing alternates in PREVIEW diagnostics.

PREVIEW → COMMIT
- PREVIEW shows full file and target path. No write without explicit COMMIT.
