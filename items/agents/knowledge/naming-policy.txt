Purpose
-------
Authoritative rules for names, UIDs, slugs, and file paths across the datasets.
Keeps humans, the Agent, and Codex consistent as we add tasks and content.

Scope
-----
- Field/key naming conventions
- UID and slug construction (events, series, venues, organizers, sources, normalizers)
- File path patterns (where JSON lives)
- Link normalization
- Booleans and relation keys

Key conventions (fields)
------------------------
- Keys use **lower_snake_case** (e.g., `display_name`, `official_link`).
- Relation keys:
  - `*_uid`  → single string (e.g., `venue_uid`)
  - `*_uids` → array of strings (e.g., `labels_uids`)
- Booleans use **"y"/"n"** only.
  - Inputs may accept yes/no/true/false/1/0, but must normalize to `"y"` or `"n"`.
- Dates: calendar dates as **YYYY-MM-DD**; timestamps as **UTC ISO 8601** (e.g., `2025-09-01T12:00:00Z`).
- URLs must be **https**.

Slugify (for all UIDs)
----------------------
1) Trim; lowercase.
2) Replace spaces and underscores with hyphens.
3) Remove characters outside `[a-z0-9-]`; collapse multiple `-`.
4) Trim leading/trailing `-`.

General UID rules
-----------------
- UIDs are **stable** once created (renames are red-lane; see permissions-policy).
- Prefer human-readable UIDs derived from official names with a small disambiguator.
- Avoid opaque hashes.
- If two entities would collide, add a short, predictable token (see below).

Entity-specific UID patterns
----------------------------
Events (`event_uid`)
- Base: `slug(official event name)`
- Disambiguator:
  - If event occurs annually: append `-yyyy` (e.g., `hampton-classic-horse-show-2025`).
  - If multiple editions in a year: append `-yyyy-mm` (e.g., `-2025-08`).
- Example:
  - `Winter Equestrian Festival` (Jan 2026) → `winter-equestrian-festival-2026-01`

Event Series (`event_series_uid`)
- Base: `slug(series label)` (e.g., `wellington-esp-series`)
- Optional seasonal/annual token if needed: `-2025` or `-winter-2025`.

Venues (`venue_uid`)
- Base: `slug(official venue name)` (e.g., `wellington-international`)
- Only add a suffix if a collision occurs (e.g., `-fl`, `-ky`). No forced `-venue` suffix.

Organizers (`organizer_uid`)
- Base: `slug(legal or public organizer name)` (e.g., `hampton-classic-inc`)

Sources (`source_uid`)
- Prefer domain-first:
  - From `https://www.hamptonclassic.com/` → `hamptonclassic-com`
  - Rule: take hostname without `www`, replace `.` with `-`.
- If no domain, slug the source name (e.g., `usef`).

Normalizers (countries/states/cities/airports, etc.)
- Countries: use ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 lowercase (e.g., `us`, `ca`) when used as codes;
  for UIDs based on names, use slugs (`united-states`).
- States (US): USPS 2-letter lowercase for codes (`fl`, `ny`); slug names otherwise.
- Cities: `slug(city-name[-state-or-country-if-needed])` to avoid collisions
  (e.g., `lexington-ky`, `wellington-fl`).
- Airports: IATA code lowercase when available (`pbi`, `isp`); if absent, slug name.

Display vs official names
-------------------------
- `display_name` — short, human-facing label (may include casing & accents).
- `official_name` — authoritative name as published by the organizer/venue.
- UIDs derive from **official_name**; display can vary without changing UID.

File path patterns
------------------
Paths are governed by the registry at `items/agents/dir-map.json` (v2). Typical patterns:

- Events:        `index/events/<event_uid>.json`
- Event Series:  `index/event-series/<event_series_uid>.json`
- Venues:        `index/venues/<venue_uid>.json`
- Organizers:    `index/organizers/<organizer_uid>.json`
- Sources:       `index/sources/<source_uid>.json`

Content collections (examples; actual roots come from dir-map.json):
- Stay:          `items/stay/<uid>.json`
- Dine:          `items/dine/<uid>.json`
- Locale:        `items/locale/<uid>.json`

Collision policy
----------------
- If a proposed UID already exists, append the smallest disambiguator:
  - For events: prefer time token (`-yyyy` or `-yyyy-mm`).
  - For venues/cities: prefer geo token (`-fl`, `-ky`, or `-us` as needed).
- Do **not** change existing UIDs to resolve new collisions; adjust the new one.

Renames & deprecations
----------------------
- Avoid UID renames. If unavoidable (red-lane), include:
  - `previous_uids`: array of strings (optional) to document history.
  - A one-line rationale in the PR description.
- Paths should not move without explicit approval (red-lane).

Link normalization
------------------
- `official_link` and other URLs must be `https://`.
- Strip tracking parameters when non-essential (e.g., `utm_*`).
- Keep canonical hostnames (avoid unnecessary redirects).

Booleans & enums
----------------
- Booleans: `"y"` or `"n"` only (lowercase strings).
- Enums: lowercase slugs (e.g., `fei`, `national`, `hunter`, `jumper`).

Examples (quick)
----------------
- Event: “Hampton Classic Horse Show” starting 2025-08-24 →  
  `event_uid`: `hampton-classic-horse-show-2025-08`  
  Path: `index/events/hampton-classic-horse-show-2025-08.json`

- Venue: “Wellington International” (Florida) →  
  `venue_uid`: `wellington-international`  
  Path: `index/venues/wellington-international.json`

- Series: “ESP Fall Series” (2025) →  
  `event_series_uid`: `esp-fall-series-2025`  
  Path: `index/event-series/esp-fall-series-2025.json`

- Source: `https://www.hamptonclassic.com/` →  
  `source_uid`: `hamptonclassic-com`  
  Path: `index/sources/hamptonclassic-com.json`

Validation hooks (alignment with other docs)
--------------------------------------------
- Validation relies on this policy plus:
  - `validation-checklist.txt` (add/update checks)
  - `operating-rules.txt` (PREVIEW → COMMIT, conflict handling)
  - `permissions-policy.txt` (lanes/rails)
- Tasks should **reject** inputs that would violate these naming rules.

Change control
--------------
- Updates to this policy are Yellow (PR required).
- Any change that would force UID/path renames must call out impacts in the PR.
