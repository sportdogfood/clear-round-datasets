CRT — PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS & LOG (Living Doc)
Version: v1.0 • Updated: 2025-09-08 (ET)

PURPOSE
- Central place to paste decisions, constraints, and conversation snippets that shape the overall project.
- Not a rules engine; it references canonical files. Use Planned Change Reports (PCR) before edits and Change Confirm Reports (CCR) after.

CANONICAL POINTERS (always current)
- Operator README: https://crt-b1434e13de34.herokuapp.com/items/agents/README.txt
- Manifest:        https://crt-b1434e13de34.herokuapp.com/items/agents/manifest.json
- Dir Map:         https://crt-b1434e13de34.herokuapp.com/items/dir-map.json
- Boot:            https://crt-b1434e13de34.herokuapp.com/items/agents/boot.json
- Ingestion Rules: https://crt-b1434e13de34.herokuapp.com/items/agents/ingestion-rules.txt
- Cards Core:      https://crt-b1434e13de34.herokuapp.com/items/agents/cards-core.txt
- Labels Rules:    https://crt-b1434e13de34.herokuapp.com/items/agents/labels-rules.json
- Events: core/rich/modes/contract under items/agents/*
- Venues: core/rich/modes/contract under items/agents/*
- Places: core/rich/modes/contract under items/agents/*

USAGE
- Append concise entries with date stamps. Keep facts and decisions crisp. Link to commits when possible.
- Do not duplicate rule text here; reference the source file URLs and include a 1–2 line rationale.

ENTRY TEMPLATE (paste and fill)
---
[YYYY-MM-DD] <Title>
Context: <one paragraph>
Decision: <final decision/constraint>
Impact: <files affected>
Links: <full URLs or commit SHAs>
---

PCR (PLANNED CHANGE REPORT) TEMPLATE
- Intent: <exact behavior to change and why>
- Primary files: <list>
- Dependent files: <list + how they must adjust>
- Risk: <behaviors that could degrade/change>
- Rollback: <how to revert>

CCR (CHANGE CONFIRM REPORT) TEMPLATE
- Original behavior: <brief, factual>
- New behavior: <brief, factual>
- Preserved: <list>
- Removed/altered: <list>
- Schema/paths: <confirm no drift or enumerate drift with why>

CURRENT OPERATING STANCE (short)
- Lanes run only with tiny kits (boot + lane core). If a kit fails to load or fails key checks, lanes STOP with a precise error.
- Hints are not facts. When official confirmation disagrees, official wins and a discrepancy is reported in preview.
- Paths must begin with /items/ and match regex in dir-map.json. No legacy branches (shows/*, annual/series/finals).

SESSION NOTES (seed)
- 2025-09-08: Introduced global boot.json + lane cores + MODE docs; established fail-closed gates and PCR/CCR discipline.
