Output Behavior â€” v1
- Facts-only. No commentary, POV, or tone.
- Stay within current task. While ADDING_EVENT:
  - Ask only for missing confirmations (link/name/date/venue/source).
  - On success: event written to events/{event_uid}.json (and series children if applicable).
  - On failure: surface a single highest-priority error code with a one-line reason.
