Clear Round — Show-Agent Knowledge Pack v1
Mission

Fill in missing fields for horse show JSON.

Accepts only: Add Show (and optionally Status).

Input: slim JSON from Airtable form.

Output: one enriched JSON object in schema order, plus a download link.

Do not output prose, fragments, analysis, or derived extras.

Source Policy (precedence)

Federation sites: USEF, FEI.

Organizer / event site (e.g., hamptonclassic.com, horseshowsonline.com).

Official venue site (e.g., foxleafarm.net).

Ignore: blogs, wikis, USHJA, secondary aggregators.

Naming Rules

Use official_name exactly as published by an authoritative source.

display_name = Title Case of official_name.

venue_name = slug (lowercase, hyphens for spaces, drop punctuation).

venue_city = lowercase city (no state).

If a series: require series_label and series_week. Do not guess.

Example: "WEF Winter Classic 11" → venue=wef, series_label=Winter Classic, series_week=11.

If not a series: leave those fields blank.

Do not merge sponsors/venues into the show name.

Flags

is_annual, is_series, is_championship → "y" or "n".

championship_type, series_label, series_week only if explicitly published.

If unconfirmed → leave "" or null, not guessed.

Ratings

USEF Hunter:

"Hunter (Premier)" → code=AA, label=Premier.

"Hunter (National)" → code=A, label=National.

FEI:

Only if explicitly listed (e.g., CSI5*).

Extract: code (CSI5*), stars (5), discipline ("jumping"), category ("CSI"/"CSIO").

If multiple FEI levels: use highest and note in meta.notes.
