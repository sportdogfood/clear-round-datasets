  "section_overview": "North Salem’s Old Salem Farm is classic Northeast showground energy: rolling hills, immaculate rings, and tight, professional scheduling. Barns sit close to the in-gates so you can bounce between the warm-up ring and competition without losing your spot. Vendor row lines the main walkway for fast fixes, braiding supplies, and caffeine between trips. Expect clear jog strip procedures, efficient drags, and ring crews who keep things moving—ideal for riders juggling equitation, hunter derbies, and the GP ring on the same day.",

      "Warm-up rings: call your lines early and pass left-to-left; flat off-peak to avoid pre-eq crowding. Keep studs, spurs, and a spare stick in the ring bag.",
      "Jog strip: arrive polished and five minutes early; bridle number front and center. Wipe boots at the rail; keep a rag and hoof oil handy.",
      "Vendor row: along the main walkway near schooling—phone ahead for studs, spur straps, or last-minute braids. Grab coffee without losing earshot of in-gate calls.",
      "Stabling: aisles stay active—trunks flush, hoses coiled, fans secured. Lunging and hand-walking only in designated areas to keep traffic clear.",
      "Ring flow: hilltop layout means a little elevation—add a few minutes between the GP field and the sand rings when you’re stacked with back-to-backs.",
      "Footing & drags: efficient drags; check posted schooling windows after weather. Pack a cooler, towel, and rain shell for fast turnarounds.",
      "Logistics: golf carts and service vehicles share narrow lanes—slow at pinch points. Truck-in arrivals stage as posted; follow staff directions at the gate.",
      "Fuel: on-site concessions near vendor row; mobile-order when offered so you stay within call range of the in-gate."
