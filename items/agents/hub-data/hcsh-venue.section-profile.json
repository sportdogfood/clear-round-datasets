  "section_overview": "Bridgehampton’s Hampton Classic is a polished, big-ring, end-of-summer showcase with grass show rings and dialed operations. Expect a busy warm-up ring before every major eq and hunter block, a clearly marked jog strip, and a boutique vendor row that can rescue any last-minute tack or turnout hiccup. Stabling is tented with efficient aisles and close access to schooling; plan your hack to the Grand Prix Field with a few extra minutes for traffic and spectator flow. Keep weather in mind—morning dew on the grass rides differently than a sun-baked afternoon—so time your schools around drags and waterings to step in feeling sharp.",

    "bullets": [
      "Warm-up: peak congestion before junior eq and pro hunter trips—flat early, call in with the ingate, and hold your spot.",
      "Grass rings: morning dew vs. afternoon firm—pack stud options and adjust your school to match the feel underfoot.",
      "Grand Prix Field access: add 5–10 minutes from stabling for spectator/foot traffic near VIP and sponsor rows.",
      "Jog strip: arrive ring-ready—number visible, towel for quick wipe-downs, hoof oil, and a spare rag in your pocket.",
      "Vendor row: the Boutique Garden has fast fixes—stirrups, gloves, spur straps, stud kits, and on-the-spot repairs.",
      "Stabling: tent aisles are busy—keep trunks flush, fans secured, and hose lines tidy to maintain flow before drags.",
      "Course walks: windows are tight—carry a ring bag (hole punch, zip ties, electrical tape) to avoid barn back-and-forth.",
      "Footing/drags: posted on the board—time your last fences to land right after a drag or water for best takeoff.",
      "Parking & drop-offs: morning queue builds quickly—schedule hay/grain deliveries and farrier slots outside peak class times.",
      "Pro tip: text the barn when you’re 10-out so your horse hits the jog strip polished and relaxed."
