  "section_overview": "Myakka City’s TerraNova runs like a purpose-built show campus: spacious competition arenas, generous warm-up, and clear lanes from stabling to in-gates so you can cycle trips without missing a gate call. Vendor row sits close to the barns for fast fixes and caffeine runs. Expect organized schooling blocks, tidy tractor drags, and a straightforward jog strip—plan your hack windows and keep a ring bag ready for quick swaps between equitation, derbies, and the GP ring.",

      "Warm-up ring: call your lines early; pass left-to-left; flat during off-peak to avoid in-gate compression before big eq and derby trips.",
      "Jog strip: arrive polished and five minutes early; number visible; keep a rag for last-second boot wipe and a spare stick in the ring bag.",
      "Vendor row: close to stabling—phone ahead for studs, spur straps, or braiding yarn; stash tape, a hole punch, and extra keepers.",
      "Stabling: aisles stay active—trunks flush, hoses coiled; fans secured; lunging only in designated spaces to keep traffic moving.",
      "Footing & drags: expect efficient drags; confirm schooling windows with the in-gate if weather pops up—pack a cooler and a rain sheet.",
      "Logistics: golf carts share lanes with lead-ins—slow at pinch points; allow a few extra minutes at peak ring changeovers.",
      "Fuel: on-site concessions near vendor row; mobile-order when possible to keep you within earshot of gate calls."
