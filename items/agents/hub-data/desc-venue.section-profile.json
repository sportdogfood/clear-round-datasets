  "section_overview": "Thermal runs like clockwork: big schedules, wide aisles, and serious mileage on the all-weather. Expect busy warm-up rings before every eq and FEI block, a clearly marked jog strip by the main arenas, and a well-stocked vendor row for last-minute hardware or turnout saves. Stabling is in tidy pods with easy access to schooling and wash racks—golf carts help but you can walk it if you plan your time. Mornings start cool and can turn to dry heat + breeze by mid-day, so manage hydration, fly spray, and coolers. The main stadium under the lights rides electric; hunters and eq stay smooth on the outer rings with consistent, drag-on-time footing.",

      "Warm-up strategy: peak traffic before eq, jr/am hunters, and FEI—flat early, then grab a vertical/oxer window just after a drag.",
      "Footing rhythm: all-weather stays consistent—plan last fences to land right after water/drag for best purchase.",
      "Jog strip: arrive ring-ready with number visible; keep a towel and hoof oil handy for quick polish in the breeze.",
      "Shade & hydration: tents and misters help, but pack extra water, electrolytes, and coolers for both horse and rider.",
      "Wind watch: secure saddle pads and numbers; bring goggles or clear lenses for night classes if dust kicks up.",
      "Stabling flow: trunks flush, fans strapped, hose lines tidy—high traffic before drags, so stage ice boots and studs box alternatives nearby.",
      "Vendor row: fast fixes—spur straps, gloves, stud kits, hairnets, boot polish—and on-the-spot braiding/tack repairs.",
      "Schooling access: add 5–10 minutes from stabling to the stadium under the lights; golf carts move fastest between drags.",
      "Night classes: brighter and louder—earplugs optional; give yourself an extra school to let them clock the atmosphere.",
      "Logistics: schedule farrier/vet outside prime hunter blocks; hay/grain deliveries land smoother mid-afternoon."
