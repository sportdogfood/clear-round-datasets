  "section_overview": "A big, efficient showgrounds built for volume and mileage. Multiple rings run simultaneously, so plan by ring cluster and keep one eye on in-gate texts. Warm-up rings are spacious but spike ahead of eq and derby classes—set your last oxer after a drag for the truest read. The jog strip is clearly posted near the hunter complex; come tidy, numbers visible, and step off with a forward trot. Vendor row sits along the main spine for quick-run fixes (gloves, studs, spur straps, last-minute braids). Stabling is organized by barns with good aisle width—fans secured, trunks flush, and ring bags staged for fast turnarounds. Footing is modern all-weather with frequent drags and water; expect consistent going from first trip to last. Golf carts help, but the quickest wins come from grouping your schooling by cluster and sending a runner between stabling and the in-gates.",
