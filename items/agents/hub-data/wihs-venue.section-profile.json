  "section_overview": "WIHS in Upper Marlboro brings big-city production to a polished indoor setting with efficient ring flow and tight call times. Expect a primary show ring inside The Show Place Arena with adjacent schooling, a clearly posted jog strip, and a compact vendor row for last-minute fixes. Stabling is organized and walkable; plan your hack routes and allow extra minutes at peak to thread golf-cart traffic. Footing and drags are posted and enforced—check the board before you tack up so you hit the warm-up ring at the right moment.",

      "Warm-up: traffic stacks up ahead of eq, junior jumpers, and FEI sessions—flat early and call your lines with the ingate.",
      "Ring flow: add 5–10 minutes from stabling to in-gate during peak; use outer lanes to avoid golf-cart pinch points.",
      "Jog strip: number visible, tack tidy—arrive early with a towel and hoof oil for last-second touch-ups.",
      "Vendor row: fast fixes—studs, spur straps, braiding yarn, and coffee; call ahead for quick pick-ups between trips.",
      "Stabling: aisles stay busy—trunks flush, fans secured, hoses coiled; use designated lunging/hand-grazing only.",
      "Footing & drags: posted intervals are enforced—check boards so your schooling aligns with drags and course walks.",
      "Course walks: arena access is timed—have a ring bag ready (hole punch, zip ties, electrical tape, rub rag).",
      "Badges & parking: credential checks at arena doors—keep your wristband/credential handy to avoid delays.",
      "Weather watch: mid-Atlantic swing can be cool and damp—pack layers and plan conservative studs after rain.",
      "Pro tip: text your groom from vendor row when you’re 10 out—saves a trip and keeps the horse relaxed at stabling."
