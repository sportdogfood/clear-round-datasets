  "section_overview": "Bluegrass horsepower at scale. Kentucky Horse Park runs multiple rings in parallel, so organize by ring cluster and live off in-gate texts. Warm-up rings are generous but get busy before eq and derby cards—grab a schooling window right after a drag for the cleanest read and set your canter with one simple vertical. Jog strip locations are clearly posted; arrive tacked and tidy with numbers front and center, quick forward trot, and a microfiber towel in your pocket. Vendor row is a full-service lifeline (studs, spur straps, gloves, stitching fixes, last-minute shads), and stabling rows are laid out with direct lines to schooling—keep fans secured, trunks flush, and ring bags pre-packed so you can pivot between hunter and GP schedules without scrambling. Footing is modern all-weather and rides best once it packs; expect frequent drags and water. Plan for Bluegrass weather mood swings: cool mornings, sun by mid-day, pop-up showers. Golf carts and bikes help, but a smart loop (stabling → warm-up → ring → vendor row) saves scratches and steps.",
