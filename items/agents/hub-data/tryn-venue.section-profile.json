  "section_overview": "Mill Spring’s show campus is built for volume and flow: big competition rings, ample warm-up, and direct paths from stabling to in-gates so you can stack trips without scrambling. Vendor row sits close to the barns for fast tack fixes and caffeine runs. Expect posted schooling blocks, efficient tractor drags, and a straightforward jog strip—plan your hack windows and keep a ring bag ready for quick swaps between equitation, derbies, and the GP ring.",

      "Warm-up ring: call your lines early, pass left-to-left, and use off-peak windows for flatting to avoid in-gate compression.",
      "Jog strip: arrive polished and five minutes early; number visible; keep a rag handy for last-second boot wipe before the jog.",
      "Vendor row: close to stabling—phone-ahead for studs, spur straps, or braiding yarn; stash a mini kit in your ring bag.",
      "Stabling: aisles get active—trunks flush, hoses coiled; respect quiet hours; lunging only in designated spaces.",
      "Logistics: golf carts and bikes share lanes—lead horses at pinch points; allow extra minutes during tractor drags and big ring changeovers.",
      "Weather: afternoon pop-ups are common—pack a cooler, rain sheet, and towel; confirm footing status with the in-gate before schooling.",
      "Food & fuel: on-site options near vendor row; mobile-order when possible to keep you within range of the in-gate."
