  "section_overview": "Venice vibes with A-circuit efficiency. Fox Lea runs a tight schedule with straightforward ring flow, easy jog strip access, and a compact layout that keeps stabling, warm-up, and vendor row within quick walking or golf-cart range. Footing rides forgiving with a sand base—great for hunters and eq—while jumpers get consistent purchase once the rings have a little traffic. Mornings are cool with a Gulf breeze; by mid-day expect humidity and sun, so plan shade breaks, electrolytes, and cool towels. Drags are punctual, schooling rings turn over fast, and the show office crew is helpful if you need a last-minute add/scratch. Keep your trunks tidy and staged—classes can move sooner than you think here.",

      "Warm-up timing: busiest 30–45 min before eq and jr/am hunter starts—grab a fence right after a drag for clean approaches.",
      "Jog strip: be ring-ready with clean legs and visible number; a towel + hoof oil live in the backpack for fast polish.",
      "Footing: sand base rides best after a little traffic—plan your last oxer once the top is packed, not freshly dragged.",
      "Shade & hydration: midday sun is real—stage coolers, electrolytes, and spare gloves by the schooling gate.",
      "Stabling flow: trunks tight to the line, fans strapped, wash racks rotate quickly—stage ice boots and towels outside the stall.",
      "Vendor row: quick fixes—spur straps, hairnets, gloves, hoof oil, studs—plus on-the-spot braiding and minor tack repairs.",
      "Ring hustle: add 5 extra minutes for hunter rings nearest vendor row; golf carts move fastest right after drags.",
      "Scheduling: farrier/vet is easiest mid-afternoon between eq blocks; hay/shavings deliveries land smoothly post-lunch.",
      "Weather watch: coastal showers pop up—pack quarter sheets and a spare pad; numbers secure with clips or tape.",
      "Food plan: grab-and-go early; lines build around noon when eq and hunter drags stack."
