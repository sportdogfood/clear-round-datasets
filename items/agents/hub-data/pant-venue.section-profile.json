  "section_overview": "PNHS in Harrisburg runs like a true indoor championship: a polished main ring with crisp ingate calls, a separate schooling ring with posted drags, and stabling that’s walkable to everything. Expect tight ring flow, clear jog strip instructions, and a compact vendor row for last-minute fixes. Plan your hack routes, hit the warm-up ring early, and keep an eye on the board so your flat, fences, and jog timing stays on point. Pack layers—temps inside are comfortable, but concourses and barns can feel chilly during fall load-in and late classes.",

      "Warm-up: traffic stacks up before eq and junior jumper blocks—flat early and call lines with the ingate.",
      "Ring flow: allow 5–10 minutes from stabling to the main ring; concourse pinch points can slow carts.",
      "Jog strip: tack tidy, number visible—arrive early with a towel and hoof oil for quick touch-ups.",
      "Vendor row: fast fixes—studs, spur straps, gloves, and braiding yarn; mobile repairs between trips.",
      "Stabling: permanent stalls—keep trunks flush, fans secured, and hoses coiled to ease busy aisles.",
      "Footing & drags: intervals are posted—time your last schools to land right after a drag.",
      "Course walks: access is timed—carry a ring bag (hole punch, zip ties, tape, rub rag) to save trips.",
      "Badges & doors: credentials checked at arena access points—keep wristbands handy to avoid delays.",
      "Weather watch: fall swings from crisp to damp—pack coolers and conservative studs after rain.",
      "Pro tip: text the barn when you’re 10 out so your horse hits the jog strip polished but relaxed."
