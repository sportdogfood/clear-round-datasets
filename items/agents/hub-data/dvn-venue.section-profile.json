  "section_overview": "Old-school prestige with big-ring polish. Devon runs tight and traditional: the Dixon Oval and the Gold Ring anchor the schedule, with tidy warm-ups, a clearly marked jog strip, and permanent shed-row stabling that keeps everything compact. Expect packed grandstands, brisk gate cadence, and quick drags—classes roll on time here. Vendor row doubles as the midway, so plan your tack and snack runs between drags. Footing firms up nicely after a little traffic; hunters and eq appreciate the smooth rhythm, while jumpers get reliable purchase under lights. Mornings are cool, afternoons can get sun-glare on the long approach, and evenings cool off fast—layer up and keep quarter sheets handy. If you stage well and move with purpose, Devon rewards efficient riders.",

      "Warm-up windows: busiest 40 minutes pre-eq and jr/am hunter trips—grab a fence right after a drag for clean tracks.",
      "Jog strip: numbers visible, legs spotless—keep a towel, rub rag, and hoof oil at the in-gate for rapid polish.",
      "Under lights: for night classes, walk the ring at dusk—sightlines and shadows change on long approaches.",
      "Footing feel: rides best with a little pack—time your last oxer once the top firms up post-traffic.",
      "Stabling flow: shed rows are tight—trunks flush to line, fans secured, ice boots staged outside for fast turnovers.",
      "Gate cadence: add/scratch early; in-gate runs briskly and will close on time between sections.",
      "Vendor row: quick fixes (hairnets, gloves, spur straps) plus on-the-spot braiding and minor tack repairs.",
      "Hand-walk route: use the perimeter lanes around vendor row when midway crowds spike.",
      "Ship-in timing: Lancaster Ave traffic compresses mornings—build in a buffer for unload and schooling.",
      "Weather plan: spring chill after sunset—stash quarter sheets, spare gloves, and a dry pad in a ring bag."
