  "section_overview": "Coastal show vibes with a tight footprint and ocean breeze. Rings, warm-up, and vendor row sit close together, so you can stage two trips out and still jog a horse or swing by a tack trailer for studs or spur straps without losing your spot at the in-gate. Morning marine layer means cooler temps and slightly deeper feel until the footing packs; set your canter early in warm-up, build an oxer after a drag, and head to the in-gate with time to breathe. Jog strip is posted—arrive tidy with number visible, trot forward, then circle clear of traffic. Stabling rows run clean lines to schooling; keep fans secured, trunks flush, and ring bags prepped (stud kit, towel, alcohol spritz). Expect regular drags and water on derby and GP days. West Coast pace is efficient but unforgiving—confirm orders by text, check card closures, and plan your loop (stabling → warm-up → ring → cooldown) to save steps. Pacific Time (PT) mornings come quick; sync alarms and crew comms so hunters, eq, and the GP ring all stay on rhythm.",
