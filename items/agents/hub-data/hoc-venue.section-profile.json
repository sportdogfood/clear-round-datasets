  "section_overview": "Big, spread-out, and built for mileage. HITS Ocala runs multiple rings at once, so plan your day by ring cluster and keep an eye on gate calls. Warm-up rings are generous but get stacked before the big eq and hunter divisions; grab a good oxer early and rotate with purpose. The jog strip is clearly marked—present tidy, legs cold, numbers visible, and move off with a crisp trot. Vendor row hugs the main action for quick fixes (spurs, gloves, hole punches) and last-minute braids. Stabling is shed-row style with wide aisles—fans secured, trunks flush, and ring bags staged so you can hustle between trips. Footing is modern all-weather across the main rings with consistent maintenance and timely drags. Golf carts help, but smart route planning does more—group your schooling, then shuttle tack by cluster to save steps and minutes.",

      "Warm-up windows: busiest 45 minutes pre-eq and jr/am hunters—set your last oxer right after a drag for clean tracks.",
      "Jog strip: keep a towel, rub rag, hoof oil, and alcohol spray at hand—numbers front-and-center and a crisp, forward trot.",
      "Ring calls: multiple rings run hot—sync to the in-gate text and plan by cluster (GP stadium vs. hunter complex).",
      "Footing feel: rides best once it’s packed—time a final vertical after a few trips for true read on ground.",
      "Stabling flow: wide shed rows—trunks flush, fans secured, aisles clear; stage ice boots and a ring bag by the door.",
      "Walk routes: use perimeter lanes around vendor row to avoid cart traffic at peak times.",
      "Schedule insurance: scratch/add early; gates move on time and will close between sections.",
      "Night sessions: check sightlines in the stadium at dusk—long approaches ride different under lights.",
      "Hydration & sun: mid-afternoon glare and heat—stash spare gloves, sunscreen, and a cool towel in your ring bag.",
      "Haul & park: plan a buffer on busy days; unload efficiently, then school by ring cluster to cut back-and-forth.",
      "Quick fixes: vendor row has braiding, spur straps, whips, and hole punches—hit it between drags, not at last call.",
      "Pro tip: pair ring runner + tack runner—one stays at stabling, one floats between warm-up and gate."
