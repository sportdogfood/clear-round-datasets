  "section_overview": "Your all-in-one winter show base in Ocala, FL. Expansive competition rings with dedicated warm-up space, a clean jog strip, and organized stabling blocks make ring turns efficient even on peak days. Vendor row and the on-site retail/dining core sit a quick golf-cart hop from most barns, so you can grab studs, gloves, or a protein bite between trips. Expect brisk morning schooling, busy in-gates, and steady tractor schedules—plan your hack windows and keep a small ring bag ready.",

      "Warm-up ring: call your lines early; keep walk traffic to the rail; hand-walk outside peak hours to avoid gate pinch points.",
      "Jog strip: arrive early with a clean presentation; have your number visible and a rag handy to wipe boots right before the jog.",
      "Vendor row: mobile-order or call ahead when possible; stash backups—hairnets, spur straps, batts—in a small ring bag.",
      "Stabling: aisles stay busy—keep trunks flush and hoses coiled; mind quiet hours and wheelbarrow paths during early schooling.",
      "Logistics: golf-cart lanes are one-way in sections—dismount at congested gates; build extra minutes for tractor drags between divisions."
