  "section_overview": "An efficient, fully-indoor show campus in Wilmington, OH that keeps winter circuits moving. Climate-controlled arenas, generous warm-up rings, and tidy in-gates help you stack trips without chaos. Vendor row sits steps from stabling, so grabbing studs, spur straps, or a quick protein bite between classes is easy. Expect regular tractor drags, clear schooling blocks, and a straightforward jog strip—plan your hack windows and keep a ring bag ready.",

      "Warm-up ring: call your lines early, pass left-to-left, and hand-walk outside peak times to avoid in-gate compression.",
      "Jog strip: arrive polished and early; number visible; keep a rag handy for last-second boot wipe before the jog.",
      "Vendor row: close to stabling—mobile-order or call ahead; keep a mini kit (hairnets, spur straps, gloves) in your ring bag.",
      "Stabling: aisles get busy—trunks flush, hoses coiled; quiet hours respected; lunging only in designated spaces.",
      "Schedule: tractor drags are frequent; build 10–15 minutes of buffer between divisions and check posted schooling blocks.",
      "Logistics: indoor doors create pinch points—dismount and lead at congested entries; allow a few extra minutes in cold snaps."
