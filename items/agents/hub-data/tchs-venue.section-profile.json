      "Warm-up: left-to-left; call your lines early. Flat off-peak—traffic stacks up ahead of eq and derby orders.",
      "Ring flow: add 5–8 minutes from stabling to the main rings at peak; hand-walk hacks on outer lanes to avoid golf-cart bottlenecks.",
      "Jog strip: arrive polished and early; number visible; keep hoof oil and a towel in your ring bag for last-second touch-ups.",
      "Vendor row: tack repair, studs, spur straps, and coffee near the plaza—call ahead for quick pick-ups between trips.",
      "Stabling: aisles stay active—trunks flush, fans secured, hoses coiled; use designated lunging and hand-grazing areas only.",
      "Footing & drags: modern all-weather; check posted drag intervals and confirm schooling blocks with the ingate before you tack up.",
      "Weather watch: mornings can be cool with a lake breeze—pack layers and consider conservative stud choices after overnight moisture.",
      "Logistics: trailer parking is separate; coordinate feed/ice runs early. Rideshare is limited—golf cart or bike saves time.",
      "Pro tip: keep a mini tool kit in the ring bag—hole punch, zip ties, electrical tape—for quick fixes on vendor row or at the warm-up."
