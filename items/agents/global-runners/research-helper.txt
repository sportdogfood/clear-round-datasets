For this venue-runner, study multiple reputable images of the competition grounds and focus on what makes this arena visually unmistakable: the shape and position of the main arena or stadium, the design of the grandstands and hospitality decks, how the entry arch or in-gate is built and branded, the color and texture of the footing, railings, and jumps, how palm trees or other signature landscaping frame the ring, the way tents, barns, and support buildings sit around the arena, and how the crowd and lighting combine to set the mood during major classes. Your output should compress these into a small set of precise, repeatable visual anchors—layout, architecture, landscape patterns, branding placement, light and crowd energy—that would let an artist build a clearly recognizable representation of this specific venue without copying any single photograph.
