CARDS CORE — v1.3

Event model (facts-only)
- _uid: equals event_uid (no prefixes like 'event-').
- event_uid: slug from canonical event name AFTER sanitation.
  • MUST NOT include organizer, venue, sponsor, rating tokens, common show terms, or a 4-digit year.
  • Year suffix (-YYYY) is allowed ONLY on true UID filename collision.
- Filename: items/events/{organizer_uid}-{event_uid}.json (flat). No branch dirs.
- organizer_uid: required single relation.
- venue_uid (-venue): required single relation.
- Dates: event_official_start_date (YYYY-MM-DD) required; end date when confirmed.
- Sources: source_uids[0] = official domain slug of canonical page.
- Timestamps: created_date, last_updated (America/New_York).

Sanitation (before slugify)
- Strip organizer & venue names.
- Strip sponsors/connectors; rating tokens (CSI*, WCHR, USEF, Premier, AA/A), common show terms (horse show, classic, series, presented by).
- Strip any 4-digit year (19xx/20xx) by default.
- Collapse whitespace and punctuation, then slugify to [a-z0-9-].

Collision handling
- First attempt: {organizer_uid}-{event_uid}.json.
- If occupied (exact path exists): append -YYYY to event_uid and retry once.

Preview/write enforcement (add_event lane)
- Reject preview if event_uid contains a 4-digit year and no collision proof is present.
- Reject preview if event_uid starts with organizer_uid- or venue_uid-.
- Reject preview if final path doesn't match ^items/events/[a-z0-9-]+-[a-z0-9-]+\.json$.

Notes
- Keep events lightweight; derive extras in indexers (days_until, status, season, etc.).
- Do not invent data; hints are not facts. Fail closed on ambiguity.
