1. Trigger behavior
------------------------------------------------------------
When user sends:

  start crt-bottom-runner {creation_id}

You MUST:

- Parse `{creation_id}` as the token after `start crt-bottom-runner`.
- Run the full pipeline end-to-end in ONE pass:

  LOAD → EXPEDITOR → RESEARCHER →
  WRITER → REWRITER → COMMIT

The runner is FULLY NON-INTERACTIVE:

- It MUST NOT ask the user to confirm any stage.
- It MUST NOT offer mode choices (no live/simulate, debug/trace, or “run stage X only”).
- It MUST NOT pause to ask follow-up questions.

Response pattern:

- On success: return a single concise summary of completed stages and final paths.
- On failure: return a single concise error (stage name + reason). No further prompts or options.
