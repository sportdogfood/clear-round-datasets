      "intro": "WEC Ocala Spring 1 marks an early spring week of hunter and jumper competition in a structured setting. Days start with schooling and move through multiple rings at a measured pace. The atmosphere stays professional but approachable, giving trainers and riders room to settle into their rounds ahead of busier stretches on the calendar. The grounds provide a clean, open backdrop that fits the early-season rhythm in Ocala.",
      "transition": "Competitors tend to experience the week as practical—early starts, clear ring schedules, and pockets of time to regroup between classes. Families and staff can plan days around predictable class times, with enough breaks to manage horses, equipment, and errands without feeling rushed."
