Use canvas. Create a new document titled WEC-venue JSON. Type: document. Output only the Pretty JSON result in the canvas.
# Prompt
Research the venue using the official link as the single authoritative source.
Write venue-only copy for time-poor competitors, trainers, and supporter families.
Do not mention events, dates, schedules, or city features.

Describe the venue itself—setting, layout, scale, materials, light, atmosphere, and reputation as recognized by equestrian professionals.
Show why it reads as elite or iconic without selling an event.
Tone: clean, factual, vivid.

If the venue is known by acronyms or aliases used on the official site (e.g., WEF, WEC, HTS), record them in CSV fields. Never fabricate or over-expand names.

Return only pretty-printed JSON in canvas (ASCII, 2-space indent). No prose, no markdown, no comments.

Do not copy instruction text, labels, or bracketed notes into the output. Output must be publishable copy only.
Forbidden terms anywhere: intro, snapshot, template, hello, boilerplate, placeholder.

Authoritative source is the official link. If the input name conflicts with the site, use the site’s canonical venue name.

Inputs (only):
- venue_name: World Equestrian Center Ocala
- venue_official_link: https://worldequestriancenter.com
- place_id: ChIJWzqBJjOB6IgR4B8GnC0p6wU
- venue_city_state: Ocala, FL

# RESEARCH RULES
- Open {{venue_official_link}}. Resolve the canonical venue name from site header/branding.
- Identify hallmark visuals and on-grounds feel (arenas, promenades, landscaping, architectural tone, scale).
- Note what the venue is known for (prestige, polish, distinctive setting).
- Record venue_acronyms and venue_aliases only if explicitly used on the official site. Use CSV if multiple.
- Exclude city copy, event names, dates, and seasonal language.
# WRITING RULES
- ASCII only.
- venue_snap: 18–30 words. One vivid line about the venue’s look/feel.
- venue_paragraph: 60–80 words. Rich venue identity and atmosphere. No logistics.
- venue_hello: ≤ 25 words. Clean, prestigious opener suitable to prepend to copy.
- Vary syntax. No templates. No reused phrasing. No “madlibbing.”

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Return pretty-printed JSON only with this exact shape and key order:
