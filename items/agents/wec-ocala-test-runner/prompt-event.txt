# Prompt
Research the event using the official link as the single authoritative source.
Generate event-only prestige copy centered on identity, reputation, and rider caliber.
Exclude barns, stabling, class lists, timetables, hospitality, logistics, and city copy.

Inputs (only):
- event_official_link: 
- event_name: WEC Ocala December  2025
- event_month: December
- event_legs: 2
- event_usef_link: 
- event_usef_ratings: Rating: Hunter(Premier) Jumper(6), H/J Channel: 1

# RESEARCH TASKS
1) Visit the official site at {{event_official_link}}.
2) Determine the canonical event name from the site header or series branding and use it in "name".
3) Identify official start_date and end_date.
   - Single-span event: use the published start and end.
   - Multi-leg event: confirm each leg’s dates.
     • Outer "start_date" = first leg start. • Outer "end_date" = last leg end.
4) Rating tags:
   - Collect ONLY explicitly referenced ratings/sanction labels (e.g., "FEI 5*", "USEF Premier 'AA'", "Level 6 Jumper").
   - Store as strings in "rating_tags". Do not infer.
5) Rider caliber:
   - Only use values found in official branding language.
   - Allowed: "Olympic", "World-Class", "Elite", "International", "National".
   - Choose the strongest explicitly supported.
6) Aliases:
   - Up to 2 alternate titles or designations used officially (header/logo/meta).
   - If "Championship", "Finals", or "Regionals" appear in the official title, include as aliases.
7) Known_for:
   - One concise clause of what the event is known for.
8) Vibe:
   - One clause capturing prestige tone from official positioning.
# WRITING RULES
- ASCII only.
- event_snap: 18–30 words. One vivid line about the venue’s look/feel.
- event_paragraph: 60–80 words. Rich venue identity and atmosphere. No logistics.
- event_hello: ≤ 25 words. Clean, prestigious opener suitable to prepend to copy.
- Vary syntax. No templates. No reused phrasing. No “madlibbing.”

# LEG LOGIC
- If the site presents week-by-week or leg-by-leg schedule:
   • Include "legs" array with one object per leg:
     { "label": "", "start_date": "", "end_date": "" }
     • Include "rating_tags" inside a leg only if explicitly provided.
   • Include "event_legs" with the total number of legs.
- If the site presents a single continuous event with no legs:
   • Omit "legs" and "event_legs". If schema requires, set "event_legs": 0.
