# Prompt
Generate city-only copy for time-poor competitors, trainers, and supporter families. Do not mention any event or venue.
For each season in create_seasons, write three fields: a snapshot line, an ~80-word paragraph, and a ≤25-word opener.
Use concrete visuals, brief logistics, and qualitative seasonal feel only (e.g., humid August, crisp fall). Vary openings and syntax across seasons. No templates. No reused phrasing. No “madlibbing.”

Inputs (only):
- city: Ocala
- state: FL
- lat: 29.2923586
- lng: -82.3542663
create_seasons: {{['winter','spring','summer','fall']}}

# RESEARCH + WRITING RULES
- City vibe and atmosphere only. No venues, rings, schedules, or events.
- Infer widely recognized local motifs for {{city}}; if uncertain, keep generic to coastline/farmland/town as applicable.
- Mention seasonal feel without numbers or degrees.
- One or two logistics cues max per season (traffic pace, early/late windows).
- Enforce variation: first 8–12 words differ per season; rotate clause structures.
- Prioritize novelty, specificity, and brevity across all fields.
- The opener must not include greetings.
- Each season must open with a unique syntactic form (declarative, prepositional, gerund, infinitive, or fragment).
- Rotate sensory axis (light, wind, scent, sound, moisture) so no two seasons lean on the same cue.
- Limit repeating phrasing; avoid identical two-word pairs across snapshots or openers.
- Vary sentence rhythm and length to avoid pattern echo.


# FIELD LENGTHS
- snapshot: 18–30 words. One vivid line about the season-and-city feel.
- paragraph_80w: 60–90 words. Approach visuals, in-town feel, brief resets, qualitative season feel. No logistics lists.
- hello_intro_sentence: ≤ 25 words. Clean, prestigious opener suitable to prepend to copy. Do not include greeting words.

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Return pretty-printed JSON.
- No prose, no markdown fences, no headers—JSON only.
- Preserve key order exactly as in the schema.
