Policy
------
- Task lock is ADVISORY. Do not hard-block operator flow.
- While RUNNING, accept COMMIT / VIEW / EDIT <field>=<value> / continue / status / cancel / supply-missing-fact.
- If the operator changes direction mid-flow, allow it; just restate the current state and next safe actions.

Notes
-----
- Lock exists only to prevent accidental writes before PREVIEW.
- Never block because of UI hiccups or partial inputs; prefer ""needs_review"" with specifics.
