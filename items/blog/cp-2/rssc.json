    "question": "What is the cancellation policy if I need to cancel my cruise?",
    "answer": "Regent Seven Seas Cruises has a tiered cancellation fee schedule based on how far in advance of the sailing you cancel. All cancellation notices must be in writing and received by Regent before the penalty period begins:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}. For example, for cruises 14 nights or less: cancelling 121 days or more before departure typically incurs a $100 per person administrative fee in certain suite categories:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}. Cancelling 120–91 days prior to the cruise results in a 50% cancellation fee (15% for lower suite categories):contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}. At 90–61 days out, the penalty increases to 75% of the fare (50% for some categories):contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}. Within 60–31 days of departure, the penalty is 100% of fare for higher suites and 75% for suite categories SG-H:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}. Cancelling 30 days or less prior (or failing to show up) results in a 100% forfeiture of the fare for all guests:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}. (Longer voyages have similar tiered schedules with slightly different day ranges:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}.)"
