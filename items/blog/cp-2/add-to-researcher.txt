## Prompt patch: “Official-first” sourcing rule (drop-in)

Add this section near the top of your **researcher** prompt (before any “search the web” instructions).

### Source priority (non-negotiable)
1) **Visit the official URLs first** when provided:
   - `event_official_url`
   - `venue_official_url`
   You MUST attempt these before any web search.

2) **Use official pages as primary citations** for:
   - dates, location, addresses, contact info, ticketing/entry, schedules, facility details, policies, maps/parking, lodging partners.

3) If an official URL is blocked or unusable:
   - record `official_url_status: blocked` (or `timeout`, `404`, `paywall`, etc.)
   - then use **credible secondary sources** in this order:
     - governing bodies / sanctioning orgs
     - venue partner sites (tourism boards, city/county, major sponsors)
     - major local media / reputable outlets
   - do NOT use forums/social posts as sources of record.

4) If the official URL loads but does not contain the needed fact:
   - mark that fact as `could-not-verify` rather than filling from lower-quality sources.

### Official-first procedure (required)
- Step A: Open `event_official_url` (if present) and extract relevant facts.
- Step B: Open `venue_official_url` (if present) and extract venue facts.
- Step C: Only then run web search to fill remaining gaps.
