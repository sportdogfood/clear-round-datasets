# CRT BLOG-CP:2 — WORK SESSION OVERVIEW (STOP POINT + OBSTACLES)

## 1. Where we stopped
- Attempted to finalize **CRR (Core Researcher)** prompt.
- CRR must: 
  - Receive expeditor-normalized identity fields.
  - Produce three factual blocks: event_research, venue_research, city_season_research.
  - Echo back identity blocks so CWR can consume a single merged payload.
- The CRR prompt draft exists but is **not finalized**, because:
  - Inputs were not fully stabilized.
  - Output shape and identity echoing were still being aligned.

## 2. What is currently correct
- CRR *must not* invent, infer, or correct anything.
- CRR *must* output “could-not-verify” instead of any null or missing field.
- Expeditor *must* normalize all nulls to “could-not-verify” before CRR sees them.
- CRR *must* echo identity blocks unchanged for CWR.
- CWR *must* receive:
  - event_identity
  - venue_identity
  - city_identity
  - event_research
  - venue_research
  - city_season_research

## 3. Known blockers / unresolved items
- CRR **input declaration** not finalized; still unclear which fields belong to:
  - event_identity vs event_leg_payload
- CRR **output shape** not fully locked (identity echoing vs research-only output).
- Confusion over where **global_rules** are read and how they are supplied.
- Confusion over **creation_id** (legacy use vs new model).
- CWR prompt cannot be finalized until CRR output shape is frozen.
- Expeditor responsibilities still not fully agreed:
  - It does NOT "map"
  - It MUST normalize all nulls to “could-not-verify”
  - It MUST pass exactly the fields CRR declares — nothing more.

## 4. Fragile areas identified
- Overlap between c-rows data and expeditor identity blocks.
- Rider_caliber positioning: who determines final value (CRR only).
- Too much drift from legacy prompt → inconsistent expectations.
- Excessive prompt blending across lanes → unclear boundaries.
- Prompt text repeatedly ballooned with unnecessary branching, causing churn.

## 5. What is missing to proceed
- A **frozen minimal CRR input specification** (one short list).
- A **frozen minimal CRR output specification** (one JSON shape).
- That alone unblocks CWR and Expeditor immediately.
- Without freezing these two shapes, no lane can proceed or be debugged.

## 6. Emotional/Process Notes (factual)
- Progress stalled due to repeated scope drift.
- Writer and researcher responsibilities became intertwined again.
- Attempting to “improve” instead of “finalize” caused rework.
- The system became over-engineered relative to the immediate need.

## 7. Next necessary step
- Freeze **ONE** CRR I/O shape.
- Then build CWR to consume it.
- Then connect expeditor to produce exactly that shape.
