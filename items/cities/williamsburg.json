  "winter_snap": "Lake air sharp over birch stands; plowed shoulders banked high along quiet lanes.",
  "winter_paragraph": "Approach on two-lanes that climb low hills and dip past frozen creeks. Hardwood silhouettes stand clean against a pale sky, and wind carries off the fields. Traffic moves measured; turns are simple, parking straightforward. The world sounds close: tire crunch, wingbeats, distant snowblower. For a reset, pull beside a cedar windbreak or step to a bridge and watch black water thread under ice. Evenings arrive blue and early, making short, disciplined loops the most efficient way to move.",
  "winter_hello": "Begin with clear cold, tidy roads, and short, efficient loops.",
  "spring_snap": "Sugar maples drip and swell; peepers lift dusk from wet ditches.",
  "spring_paragraph": "Roads darken with melt and rain, then shine as breaks of sun slide over orchards. Banks retreat, revealing last yearâ€™s grass and the first green at fence lines. Air turns soft and earthy; creeks chatter at culverts. Town pace quickens but stays orderly, with brief lines and easy parking. Reset by idling near a split-rail to watch robins work the thawed turf. Best windows land early when fog lifts, or late when the light warms along the ridge.",
  "spring_hello": "Roll in with soft air, wet stone, and bright orchard edges.",
  "summer_snap": "Blue bay winks through pines; orchard rows hum while warm wind rides the hills.",
  "summer_paragraph": "Two-lanes curve between lakes and fruit blocks, shade pooling where maples meet. Air leans warm and green, cicadas steady along hedges. Traffic remains predictable outside beach hours; turns are clean, parking cooperative. For a reset, pull at a bluff turnout to watch boats stitch the bay or walk a minute into pine shade. Late-day delivers the best pace as breeze comes off the water and glare eases. Early runs are equally smooth before heat gathers inland.",
  "summer_hello": "Work early or late, follow the lake breeze, keep moves short.",
  "fall_snap": "Orchards flame red and gold; low sun washes stubble while bay lies glassy.",
  "fall_paragraph": "Approach opens as leaves thin and long views return over ridgelines. Air turns crisp with apple and leaf, and the roads feel exact. Town traffic stays steady yet manageable; quick stops fit between school hours. Reset by parking beside a hedgerow to watch cranes drift or by a dock to see color mirrored in flat water. Light runs long and amber, making decisions simple. Early and late windows are best as the hills breathe cool and clear.",
  "fall_hello": "Settle into long light, bright color, and cooperative roads."
