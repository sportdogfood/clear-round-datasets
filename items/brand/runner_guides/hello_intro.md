# RUNNER SOP — hello_intro
Path: `items/brand/runner_guides/hello_intro.md`
Version: 1.0.0

## Purpose
Create a vivid, travel-brochure intro that spotlights the event, venue, and host city, highlights elite rider caliber, and delivers an exciting, visual, high-energy paragraph.

## Outcome
- One paragraph. 110–180 words.
- Exactly two links, woven as proper nouns:
  1) Event name → `event_official_link`
  2) Venue name → `venue_official_link`
- Tell → write → tell cadence.

## Sources
- Primary: event official page; venue official page.
- Optional: `geo_link` for month/city naming only.

## Derive These Beats
- **Time**: humanized dates + one cadence clause (early week → finals energy).
- **Season**: one term (e.g., late-summer).
- **Event**: stature + one hallmark (e.g., marquee grand prix).
- **Venue**: two visuals visible on official pages (grandstand scale, tent-lined arenas, desert backdrop).
- **City**: one vibe + proximity phrase from geo context.
- **Rider Range**: only if the event page confirms it (e.g., Olympians, U25). If not confirmed, omit.

## Write It
- Open with season + city + linked event name.
- Add hallmark and weekly cadence.
- Paint two venue visuals.
- Add city vibe and proximity.
- Add rider range if confirmed.
- Close with a neutral handoff to planning sections.

## Style
- Competition-first travel brochure. Concrete visuals. No hype words.
- Active voice. Short, clean sentences. Vary length for rhythm.

## Link Weaving
- Link each proper noun once. No “click/visit/confirm” phrasing.
- Do not add a third link.

## Do / Don’t
**Do**
- Use only official pages + geo.
- Translate facts into imagery and cadence.
- Keep it inviting and energetic.

**Don’t**
- No directions, parking, street names, traffic mentions.
- No ticket/prices/weather numbers.
- No hotel or restaurant names.
- No star ratings (CSI/CSIO/*). No footing specs.

## Self-Check (before submit)
- Two links present and only once each.
- At least three beats included. Rider range included only if confirmed.
- Word count 110–180. One paragraph.
- Reads like a brochure, not a schedule or instruction sheet.
- Final sentence naturally hands off to the transition.

## Example Moves (not templates)
- “Late-summer in {city} centers the [Event]…”
- “The week opens measured and crests with {hallmark}…”
- “{Visual 1} and {Visual 2} keep sightlines open…”
- “{City vibe} sits close for quick resets…”
- “Fields draw {confirmed rider range}…” *(omit if unconfirmed)*
- “That momentum sets up where to stay, eat, and reset next.”

## Evidence Notes
- If you assert rider range, paste the confirming phrase from the event page into your internal notes for QA (do not emit).

## Hand-off
End with a neutral cue to the transition. Example endings: “sets up planning the week,” “frames what to book and when,” “hands off to where to sleep, eat, and reset.”
