Here’s a clean, publisher-ready Privacy Policy tailored to your CRT setup (Heroku proxy + public GitHub JSON + optional GPT Action). You can drop this on a `/privacy` page. I’ve filled what I can from context and left a couple of obvious placeholders you can replace.

# Privacy Policy — Clear Round Travel (CRT)

**Effective date:** August 28, 2025

Clear Round Travel (“**CRT**”, “**we**”, “**our**”, “**us**”) operates lightweight web services that proxy and publish equestrian event metadata and related open datasets. This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.

If you have questions, contact us at **[privacy@sportdogfood.com](mailto:privacy@sportdogfood.com)** (or **[philip@sportdogfood.com](mailto:philip@sportdogfood.com)**).

## 1) Scope

This Policy covers:

* **CRT Items Proxy (Heroku)** – a read-only API that serves JSON from public GitHub repositories (e.g., `/items/.../*.json`).
* **CRT GPT Action** – an integration that calls the Items Proxy to fetch those public JSON files.
* **Clear Round Datasets (GitHub/GitHub Pages)** – static JSON files hosted publicly.

It **does not** cover other Sport Dog Food services (e.g., commerce or account systems) that have their own privacy terms.

## 2) What we collect

We design CRT to avoid collecting personal data. However, standard internet operations generate some technical data:

### A. Server/Access Logs (from the Items Proxy)

When you call our Heroku endpoint, our systems and hosting provider automatically process:

* IP address, date/time, request method/URL, response code, response time
* User-Agent and (if present) Referrer
* Heroku request identifiers and error traces (on failures)

**No cookies** are set by the API, and **no client-side tracking** runs on API responses.

### B. API Key (optional)

If you (or your integration) use a custom header like `x-crt-key` to restrict access, the key value is validated transiently in memory and may appear in short-lived logs for troubleshooting.

### C. Public Dataset Content

We host and proxy **public JSON** files that typically contain event and venue metadata. These files are intentionally published and **do not contain sensitive personal information**. If you believe a file includes personal data, see **Section 10**.

### D. Communications

If you email us, we’ll receive your email address and any content you send.

## 3) How we use data

* **Provide the service** – route and serve public JSON as requested.
* **Security & abuse prevention** – monitor for rate-limiting, misuse, and service integrity.
* **Diagnostics** – debug errors and improve reliability (e.g., upstream 404s, timeouts).
* **Compliance** – respond to lawful requests and enforce our terms.

## 4) Legal bases (EEA/UK users)

Where applicable, we rely on:

* **Legitimate interests** (running a secure, reliable API that serves public data),
* **Legal obligation** (where we must retain limited records), and
* **Consent** (if you explicitly provide it, e.g., contacting us).

## 5) Sharing & processors

We use reputable providers to run CRT:

* **Heroku (Salesforce, USA)** – hosting and transient logging of the Items Proxy.
* **GitHub (USA/EU)** – hosting public repositories and GitHub Pages that serve JSON.

We may share minimal log excerpts with these providers to diagnose issues. We don’t sell your personal information or use it for ads.

### About the GPT Action

When you use CRT via ChatGPT, **your prompts are processed by OpenAI** under their terms and privacy policies. CRT receives only the outbound HTTP request generated by the action (e.g., a GET to `/items/.../*.json`). We don’t receive or log your full ChatGPT conversation.

## 6) International transfers

Our services and processors may operate globally. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) offered by our providers.

## 7) Retention

* **Server logs:** kept **no longer than 30 days** (often less) unless needed to investigate abuse or legal requests.
* **Public datasets:** retained indefinitely as open data.
* **Emails:** retained as long as reasonably necessary to address your inquiry.

## 8) Your rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of personal data, and to object to certain processing. You can also request a copy (portability) or lodge a complaint with a regulator.

To exercise rights: **[privacy@sportdogfood.com](mailto:privacy@sportdogfood.com)**. We’ll verify and respond as required by law.

### California (CPRA) notice

We do **not** “sell” or “share” personal information as defined by CPRA. We process limited technical data for service delivery and security.

## 9) Security

We use TLS for transport, principle of least privilege, and minimal data surface area. No cookies or trackers are set by the API. While no system is perfectly secure, we continuously work to reduce risk.

## 10) Public data & takedowns

Our datasets are intended to be **non-personal open data**. If you believe a CRT-hosted JSON file inadvertently includes personal information or infringes rights, email **[privacy@sportdogfood.com](mailto:privacy@sportdogfood.com)** with:

* The exact URL(s),
* The specific content at issue, and
* The basis for your request.

We will review promptly and, where appropriate, remove or redact the content.

## 11) Children

CRT is not directed to children under 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them.

## 12) Changes to this Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. The “Effective date” will change, and we’ll keep prior versions upon request.

### Developer Notes / Implementer Checklist (not part of the public page)

* If you enable the optional header key (`x-crt-key`) on Heroku, this Policy already covers it.
* If you later add analytics, cookies, or user accounts, you’ll need to update Sections 2–3 and 9.
* If you add additional processors (e.g., CDN, APM), list them in **Section 5**.
* Replace the postal address with your company address; set the preferred contact email.

*This document is provided for your convenience and should be reviewed by counsel for your specific obligations (e.g., GDPR/UK GDPR/CPRA, sectoral rules).*
