# instruction-bootstrap.txt
# Version: 2025-10-13.bootstrap-1
# Purpose: This minimal loader instructs the ClearRound Structure Runner
#          to fetch the authoritative instruction set from the GitHub repo.
#          Keeps repo-controlled rules under versioning and removes 8K text limit.

LOAD
- source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportdogfood/clear-round-datasets/main/items/runners/structure/instruction.txt
- attempts: 2
- timeout: 5
- checksum_policy: ignore
- fallback_behavior: run-local-if-fail

NOTES
- The remote file (above) is the canonical instruction set.
- If the fetch fails, the runner will fall back to this local bootstrap behavior:
    * Require "canonical_base", "event_link", and "content_link" or "docs_path"
    * Produce the seven standard outputs
    * Warn: "Remote instruction fetch failed; used bootstrap defaults"
