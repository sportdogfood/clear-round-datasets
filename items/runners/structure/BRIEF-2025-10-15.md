# BRIEF-2025-10-15.md

## What we did today
- Locked custom domain to **blog.clearroundtravel.com** (single domain; HTTPS enforced).
- Cleaned public entry points:
  - `/` → redirects to `/blogs/`
  - Verified `/blogs/` and `/blogs/2025/` render.
- Fixed XML issues by removing leading comments/BOM before `<?xml ...?>` in RSS/Sitemap samples.
- Standardized **runner-light** scope: exactly **2 outputs** (post `index.html` + `*-publish.json`) per publish.
- Confirmed templates live under `docs/blogs/templates/` and remain read-only.

## Still to address before test/live
1) **Triggers (Items):** Ensure all trigger `content_link`, `event_link`, `images_link` point to **items.clearroundtravel.com/items/...** (no raw.git, no mirrors).
2) **Expeditor (Runner):** Confirm it fetches from `/items/*` only and commits via `/docs/commit-bulk` only.
3) **OpenAPI (Runner UI):** Spec must include `GET /items/{path}` (read) and `POST /docs/commit-bulk` (write). Nothing else required for runner-light.
4) **Final smoke publish:** Run a single post from a trigger and confirm:
   - Post page resolves under `blog.`
   - Publish JSON is present and canonical links are correct
   - No references to `docs.` or raw.git in rendered HTML
5) **Indexer (later):** After go-live, wire the scheduled job that regenerates blogs index, year index, RSS, sitemap, and manifest.

## Definition of “done” for go-live (runner-light)
- Inputs read via `/items/*`; outputs written via `/docs/commit-bulk`.
- One successful publish folder containing `index.html` + `<slug>-publish.json`.
- Public page renders with correct canonical/meta; JSON validates with expected fields.
