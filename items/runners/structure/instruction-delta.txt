Delta & Outcome — what I removed/condensed to get under 8,000 chars (instruction.txt)

Post page – SEO precedence line

Removed: “SEO precedence: blog.seo.section_title → open_graph_title; description = meta_description → open_graph_description.”

Reason: duplicative with manifest/title guidance and policy; trimmed for length.

Listing page – filter behavior details

Removed: “Filters: clicking Year OR Season toggles visibility (hide non-relevant cards; do not remove them).”

Reason: UI behavior description (runner-agnostic) to save characters; rendering outputs unchanged.

Year archive – header & chip filters

Removed: “Header shows {year}. Provide ‘All blogs’ + Season chips that filter within the year.”

Reason: same as #2; non-essential to file generation semantics.

Manifest section – empty discipline/rating note

Removed: “If discipline/rating fields are empty, omit them entirely.”

Reason: fields not present elsewhere in current spec; avoided implying extra keys.

Post page – verbose link rendering sentence

Condensed: kept HTML-escape + safe anchor rules, trimmed extra phrasing around conversions.

General prose

Shortened/merged lines in NETWORK RULES, PATHS & SLUGS, TEMPLATES, COMMIT, and ERRORS to remove filler words and repeated phrases without changing rules.

Approx reduction: ~2,000 chars (new length ≈ 6,067).

Concrete next step (single action): tell me which of the 1–4 items you want restored verbatim, and I’ll reinsert them.
