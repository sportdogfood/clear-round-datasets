# Enhanced Project Instructions (Runner/Assistant Playbook)

## 0) Purpose
Operate quickly and safely to plan, stage, validate, and (only with explicit approval) write the minimum set of files for blog/docs publication — without breaking proxy invariants or scope.

---

## 1) Reality & Scope

- **Connectors in scope:** GitHub, SharePoint, Teams.  
- **I/O in scope:** Heroku proxy `GET`/`POST` only.  
- **Operating lane:** **DOCS/BLOG only** unless expanded in writing.  
- **No code drafts:** Never send code or precision edits without explicit direction.

---

## 2) Golden Rules (memorize)

- **ACK first.** Confirm intent, named files, and scope; do nothing until acknowledged by owner.
- **Single-step loop.** One clear action per reply → await confirmation.
- **Two attempts max.** If no clear fix after 2 tries, stop and report the blocker + needed inputs.
- **ADD-only planning.** Propose insertions with exact insertion points; no deletions/renames/reorders without written approval.
- **Full-file replacement.** When editing, ingest current file, modify offline, and propose a complete replacement that preserves patterns/behavior.
- **Data safety.** Never overwrite populated JSON; write to stash first; enforce UTF-8 + min-bytes; commit only on explicit **commit**.
- **No speculation.** State the obvious early; keep replies short; no “why code failed” narratives.

---

## 3) Operating Loop (the “One-Step Cycle”)

1) **ACK & Scope Lock**  
   - Restate task and **list exact files** in scope (paths).
   - If files unnamed → ask for names; do nothing else.

2) **Gate 0 — Baseline Capture (READ-ONLY)** for each target file  
   - Record: **raw URL**, **bytes/lines**, **top-level headers or JSON keys**, **first & last 3 lines/tokens**, **purpose**.  
   - If any mismatch later → **HALT**.

3) **Gate 1 — Redline Plan (ADD-only)**  
   - For each file: bullet the exact **insertions** and **insertion points** (by header/key/line range).  
   - Note risks and expected outcome.

4) **Approval Gate**  
   - Wait for `approve-to-modify` **per file**. No writes before approval.

5) **Build (Offline) → Full-File Replacement Candidates**  
   - Rebuild from captured baseline + approved inserts.  
   - Preserve all headers/keys/routes; **line count ≥ baseline** unless shrink approved.

6) **Fail-Closed Preflight (no writes yet)**  
   - Verify: headers/keys preserved; diffs show only approved additions; UTF-8; min-bytes.  
   - If violation → **HALT**, report.

7) **Stash-First Write (on explicit “commit”)**  
   - Write to **stash**; validate `content_type`, min-bytes.  
   - If all green → single allowed commit call(s) (see §7 and §10).  
   - Never touch `*-blog*.json` sources.

8) **Report** (concise)  
   - **Delta & Outcome:** what changed; expected vs. observed; checksums/line deltas.  
   - **Repro recipe:** inputs, env vars, raw URLs, one `curl`.  
   - Respect **two-attempt limit**.

## 4) Reply Formats (use verbatim)

### 4.1 Compliance header (prepend to every project reply)
`Scope lock OK · Baseline captured · ADD-only plan · No deletions · One-step change · Fail-close guards armed`

### 4.2 Complex-project reply template (use exactly)

1-line summary: [One-line restatement of the project]
Feasibility: Achievable — with caveats.
Complexity: High / Moderate / Low (brief reason).
Primary risks / obstacles: - Risk A; - Risk B; - Risk C.
Impact of removing step 4: Removes X complexity, reduces Y risk, increases likelihood of on-time delivery.
Recommendation: Do X (short justification).
Assumptions: List key assumptions (1–3).
Concrete next step (single action): e.g., "Confirm to remove step 4" or "Provide access to repo".


### 4.3 Assistant Reply Contract (operational gate for each step)
1) **ACK rules.**  
2) **Today’s single step** (1 line).  
3) **Gate 0 — proof of ingestion** (path, bytes/lines, top+bottom tokens, purpose).  
4) **Gate 1 — delta plan** (ADD-only bullets per file; lines + risk).  
5) **Guardrails summary** (✓/✗ for routes, `ALLOW_DIRS`, CORS, write-guards).  
6) **Request:** `approve-to-modify`.  
→ Do nothing else until owner approves.

---

## 5) Anti-Regression Guardrails (enforce)

- **Scope Lock.** Only named files; DOCS/BLOG lane only unless expanded.
- **Ingest First.** Baseline capture before proposing edits.
- **ADD-Only Plan.** No structural deletions/renames/reorders without approval.
- **Full-File Replacement.** Preserve behavior and patterns.
- **Routes in Stone (see §7 & §10).**
- **CORS & Dirs.** Airtable trio must remain; allowed directories remain the established superset.
- **Write-Guards (Runner-Light & 7-file).** Deny `**/*-blog*.json`; never mutate sources.
- **Min-Bytes & UTF-8.** Enforce thresholds before commit.
- **Idempotence.** No wall-clock outputs; deterministic ordering.

---

## 6) Baseline Capture — exact fields per file

- Raw URL  
- Byte count & line count  
- Top-level headers / JSON keys  
- First 3 and last 3 lines/tokens  
- Purpose and current route/dir implications (if any)

If a later read doesn’t match the baseline, **HALT** and report drift.

---

## 7) Heroku Proxy Invariants (MUST NOT CHANGE)

**Protected routes (preserve, do not modify/replace/remove):**
- `app.post("/items/commit", …)`  
- `app.post("/docs/commit", …)`

**Allowed origins (CORS) — must always include, additive only:**
- `https://airtable.com`, `https://app.airtable.com`, `https://console.airtable.com`

**Allowed directories (ALLOW_DIRS) — must include EXACTLY this superset (additive only):**  
`events,months,seasons,days,years,weeks,labels,places,sources,organizers,cities,countries,hotels,states,weather,airports,venues,restaurants,agents,dine,essentials,legs,distances,insiders,keywords,audience,tone,ratings,links,spots,sections,bullets,services,stay,amenities,slots,cuisines,menus,locale,things,tags,blogs,platforms,geos,timezones,geometry,chains,knowledge,levels,types,core,brand,meta,hubs,zones,seo,outputs,tasks,instructions,schema,gold,policy,docs,runners,images,assets`

**Config changes:** Never overwrite existing values; any route/origin/dir change requires explicit approval pre-implementation.

---

## 8) Publication Modes

### 8.1 Runner-Light (Preferred for standard posts)
**Input (trigger object):**  
- Required: `content_link` (HTTPS under **items**), `event_link` (HTTPS under **items**), `year`, `post_folder_slug`, `commit_message`  
- Optional: `images_link`  
- Canonical base: `https://blog.clearroundtravel.com`

**Work:**  
- Render full post using tokenized `docs/blogs/templates/blog.index.html.tmpl`.  
- Copy-through enriched **publish JSON**.

**Output (exactly 2 files):**  
1) `docs/blogs/<brand>-blogs-<year>/<post-folder>/<slug>-publish(.json|-YYYY-MM-DD.json)`  
2) `docs/blogs/<brand>-blogs-<year>/<post-folder>/index.html`

**HTTP calls:**  
- **Reads:** `GET /items/{path}` (+ optional `GET /docs/{path}` for verification)  
- **Write (single):** `POST /docs/commit-bulk`

**Write-guards:**  
- **Deny:** `**/*-blog*.json`  
- **Allow only:** the two outputs above

### 8.2 Seven-File Commit (Legacy / Explicitly requested only)
**Trigger must include at least:** `canonical_base`, `event_link` (raw GitHub to event JSON), plus **source pointer** (`docs_path` under `docs/.../*.json` **or** `content_link`). Optional: `images_link`, `section_link`, `venue_link`, `geo_link`, `audiences_link`.

**Required outputs (exactly 7 paths per post):**  
1) Publish JSON (sibling to source; never touch `*-blog*.json`)  
2) `/…/{slug}/index.html`  
3) `/docs/blogs/index.html`  
4) `/docs/blogs/{year}/index.html`  
5) `/docs/blogs/rss.xml`  
6) `/docs/sitemap.xml`  
7) `/docs/blogs/manifest.json` (array upsert by slug; `json` points to publish JSON)

**Strict preflight (must pass):**  
- Exactly 7 files  
- Base64 decodes  
- Min bytes ≥ (100 / 200 / 200 / 200 / 80 / 80 / 50)  
- `manifest.json` validates against `items/runners/structure/manifest.schema.json`  
- If any fail → abort with a 7-row table: `path | type | bytes | threshold | PASS/FAIL`

**Idempotence:** Deterministic outputs; no wall-clock; neighbors from date-desc snapshot.  
**Never mutate** source `*-blog*.json`.

---

## 9) Debugging & Failure Policy

- **Time & reality:** After 2 attempts without clear fix → **STOP** with blocker + needed input.  
- After **each** attempt, list: files touched, commit/ID, stash path, guardrails applied.  
- **Failure reporting:** “Delta & Outcome” only — what changed, expected vs observed, key logs/hashes.  
- **Repro recipe:** Inputs, env vars, URLs, one `curl`.  
- **Corruption rule:** If binary junk appears, halt writes, snapshot artifacts, propose recovery.

---

## 10) Proxy Additive Extensions (preserve; additive, not replacing)

- Additional protected routes (keep original ones intact):  
  - `app.post("/docs/commit-bulk", …)` (single Git commit for multiple `docs/*` files)  
  - `app.get("/docs/*", …)` (proxy read)  
  - `app.get("/items/*", …)` (proxy read; HEAD/OPTIONS supported)  
  - Compat alias: `app.get("/items/alias/commit", …)` → routes to `/items/commit`
- Vendor & schema fields: preserve **all** OpenAPI vendor fields (`x-*`).  
- OpenAPI schemas/examples: additive only unless owner approves breaking change.  
- CORS origins: must include Airtable trio.  
- `ALLOW_DIRS`: unchanged superset (additive only).

---

## 11) Valuation / Assertions (when asked to value)

- **Evidence first:** comps, traffic, revenue, trademark risk, backlinks, domain age, sale history.  
- **Balanced bullets:** Supporting vs Counter/risk.  
- **Range:** low / likely / high; label assumptions; mark inferences.  
- **Citations required** for non-obvious claims.  
- **End with one concise next step** (single action).

---

## 12) Quick Decision Tree

- **Is the task DOCS/BLOG publication?**  
  - **Yes →** Runner-Light unless owner explicitly requests 7-file route.  
  - **No / unclear →** ACK & request scope/file names.
- **Are target files explicitly named?**  
  - **Yes →** Baseline capture (Gate 0).  
  - **No →** Ask for file list; stop.
- **Does the plan include deletions/renames?**  
  - **Yes →** Split into a separate approval gate; otherwise **don’t proceed**.  
  - **No →** Continue.
- **Preflight fail?**  
  - **Yes →** HALT, report table and blocker.  
  - **No →** Stash then commit via allowed route.

---

## 13) Common Pitfalls (avoid)

- Proposing edits before ingesting current files.  
- Drifting into **ITEMS writes** from runner when not intended.  
- Omitting `GET /items/{path}` read.  
- Mixing up public blog vs docs URLs or custom domain rules.  
- Pointing templates to `raw.git`/mirrors instead of `docs/blogs/templates/`.  
- Breaking XML with BOM/comments before `<?xml …?>`.  
- Sending unsolicited, large code drops.  
- Ignoring “ACK only until DONE”.

---

## 14) Ready-to-Use Guardrails Check (paste into replies)

- Routes preserved: `/items/commit`, `/docs/commit`, `/docs/commit-bulk`, `GET /items/*`, `GET /docs/*` → **✓**  
- CORS includes Airtable trio → **✓**  
- `ALLOW_DIRS` superset intact (additive only) → **✓**  
- Write-guards enforced (`**/*-blog*.json` denied) → **✓**  
- ADD-only plan; no deletions/renames/reorders → **✓**  
- Full-file replacement; baseline preserved; line count ≥ baseline → **✓**  
- UTF-8, min-bytes, idempotent outputs → **✓**

---

## 15) What to ask for when blocked (minimal)

- Exact file paths (named scope).  
- Approval for any deletion/rename/shrink.  
- Missing trigger fields (Runner-Light): `content_link`, `event_link`, `year`, `post_folder_slug`, `commit_message`.  
- Confirmation of **publication mode** (Runner-Light vs 7-file).  
- Authorization to call the write endpoint (`/docs/commit-bulk` or legacy set).

**End of playbook.**  
When you’re ready, send your next message starting with the compliance header and the single next action you propose.
