Absolutely! Here's a summary of modifications required for Truth, Normalizer, Enrichment, Reference, and Contentâ€”based on our current structure.

1. Truth (Official Data)

Goal: Ensure that the core, verified data is structured and stored as the official source of truth.

Key Tables:

Events (event_uid, event_official_name, event_official_start_date, venue_uid)

Venues (venue_uid, venue_name, venue_address)

Hotels/Stays (hotel_uid, hotel_name, hotel_address, etc.)

Dining (dining_uid, restaurant_name, address, etc.)

What to Modify:

Make sure the event_uid follows the slug-based structure.

Ensure venue records contain location details and are linked to events properly.

Enforce canonical names and remove extra sponsors/ratings in names for all official data.

2. Normalizer (Standardized Data)

Goal: Ensure that all data is in standardized formats for easy querying and uniformity across the system.

Key Tables:

Normalizer_Time: Standardize date formats (ISO 8601), normalize event duration.

Normalizer_Location: Normalize location data (city, state, country) and geo-coordinates.

Normalizer_Weather: Ensure all weather-related data (temperature, forecasts) is in a unified format.

What to Modify:

Create/modify normalizers to ensure that data like dates, locations, and weather data are consistently formatted.

Ensure that location data is standardized across events, venues, and stays.

Time data should be normalized into a unified start/end date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).

3. Enrichment (Derived Data)

Goal: Add contextual or derived data to enhance existing records.

Key Tables:

Enrichment_Events: Derived fields like event duration, category (e.g., CSI5*), number of participants, seasonality.

Enrichment_Venues: Derived info like rating, distance to airport, nearby attractions (restaurants, hotels).

Enrichment_Stays/Dining: Derived insights like popularity, average review score, price range.

What to Modify:

Add enrichment fields that provide additional context to events and venues (e.g., average reviews, pricing, popularity).

Derive seasonality for events (i.e., determining the best time to attend based on historical attendance or season).

Add dynamic recommendations for hotels, dining, and local activities based on user preferences and event types.

4. Reference (Verified Data)

Goal: Store external, verified data to be used as supporting content for enriching the event and venue records.

Key Tables:

Reference_Events: External links to verified event schedules, official sources.

Reference_Venues: External links to verified venue details (e.g., booking pages, review platforms).

Reference_Hotels/Restaurants: Data sourced from external platforms like Booking.com, Yelp, or Google Reviews.

What to Modify:

Ensure all external sources are properly added under source_uids to each event and venue.

Link external sources to your event and venue records for content enrichment and validation.

Maintain a clean, curated set of external references (e.g., official websites, third-party reviews) for each event and venue.

5. Content Generation

Goal: Generate dynamic blog posts, web pages, and other content based on truth and enriched data.

Key Tables:

Content: Generate content using event details, venue data, enriched data (reviews, popularity), and SEO rules (title, description).

SEO Tags: Ensure every content block (e.g., blog posts) has the right SEO data (meta descriptions, titles, OG tags).

What to Modify:

Create dynamic templates for generating SEO-optimized content (title, description, URL).

Ensure that Tone and POV rules are applied dynamically for each piece of content.

Linking: Ensure all external links (e.g., event ticketing, hotels, dining) are referenced correctly.

Summary of Modifications:

Truth: Ensure official data (event names, venue info, hotel stays) is correct, standardized, and linked.

Normalizer: Normalize dates and locations to consistent formats for seamless querying and data integration.

Enrichment: Add contextual and derived fields to make events and venues more dynamic (e.g., event duration, hotel popularity).

Reference: Integrate verified external sources to support the main data records and provide validation.

Content Generation: Create dynamic content blocks, applying POV, Tone, and SEO rules for a fully functional website/blog pipeline.
