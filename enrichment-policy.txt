Absolutely! Documenting this structure is crucial for both clarity and future development. Here's a **structured documentation** for how **enrichment, normalization, and modular data binding** works across **events, venues**, and related data points, making it easy for future collaborators to understand and follow the process.

## **Event and Venue Data Enrichment Documentation**

### **Overview**

The **event and venue data enrichment** process is designed to ensure that our events and venues are always updated with **accurate**, **relevant**, and **dynamic** information. By utilizing **modular enrichment**, we can dynamically **add new data** (like hotel suggestions, weather data, popularity scores) without affecting the core **truth** data for events and venues.

### **Data Structure Overview**

1. **Core Data Tables**:

   * **Truth Data** (Official, Verified Data)

     * **Event data**: Includes official event name, dates, venue, and source information.
     * **Venue data**: Includes venue name, address, city, state, and geographical data.
   * **Enrichable Data** (Dynamic, Enriched Data)

     * **Event Analysis**: Includes derived fields like event popularity, attendance, and suggestions.
     * **Venue Trending**: Includes enrichment like venue ratings, nearby hotels, and restaurants.

2. **Dynamic Enrichment**:

   * **Data Enrichment** is handled **modularly** via **enrichment modules** such as `event_analysis` and `venue_trending`.
   * This data is **dynamically linked** to core event and venue records via **UIDs**.

### **1. Event and Venue Data Binding**:

#### **Event Record**:

* Events have the **core data** in **truth\_event** and are **linked to enrichment modules** (e.g., `event_analysis`, `event_weather`).
* Example:

  ```json
  {
    "event_uid": "hampton-classic-horse-show",
    "venue_uid": "hampton-classic-horse-show-venue",
    "event_analysis_uids": ["event_popularity_1", "event_weather_forecast_1"],
    "event_trending_uids": ["event_trending_1"]
  }
  ```

#### **Venue Record**:

* Venues are enriched with dynamic data such as **venue ratings**, **nearby amenities**, and **local attractions**.
* Example:

  ```json
  {
    "venue_uid": "hampton-classic-horse-show-venue",
    "venue_name": "Wellington International",
    "venue_rating": 4.5,
    "venue_trending_uids": ["venue_trending_1"],
    "nearby_hotels": ["hotel_1", "hotel_2", "hotel_3"]
  }
  ```

#### **Enrichment Modules**:

* **event\_analysis**: Contains insights on **event popularity**, **attendee ratings**, etc.

  * Example:

    ```json
    {
      "event_analysis_uid": "event_popularity_1",
      "event_uid": "hampton-classic-horse-show",
      "popularity_score": 85,
      "attendance_forecast": "high"
    }
    ```

* **venue\_trending**: Contains insights on **venue ratings**, **hotel recommendations**, **local dining**, etc.

  * Example:

    ```json
    {
      "venue_trending_uid": "venue_trending_1",
      "venue_uid": "hampton-classic-horse-show-venue",
      "venue_rating": 4.5,
      "nearby_hotels": ["hotel_1", "hotel_2"],
      "nearby_dining": ["restaurant_1", "restaurant_2"]
    }
    ```

### **2. Field Classifications and Tables**

#### **Base Fields** (Official, Static):

* **Event**: `event_uid`, `event_official_name`, `event_start_date`, `event_end_date`, `venue_uid`
* **Venue**: `venue_uid`, `venue_name`, `venue_address`, `venue_city`, `venue_state`

#### **Binder Fields** (Relational Data):

* **Event to Venue**: `venue_uid`
* **Event to Sources**: `source_uids`
* **Event to Event Series**: `event_series_uids`
* **Venue to Related Hotels**: `nearby_hotels`
* **Venue to Related Venues**: `related_venues`

#### **Derived Fields** (Calculated, Formula-Driven):

* **Event**: `event_duration`, `event_state`, `event_month`, `event_season`
* **Venue**: `venue_distance_to_airport`, `venue_popularity_score`

#### **Enrichable Fields** (Dynamic Updates):

* **Event**: `event_popularity`, `event_suggestions`, `event_weather_forecast`
* **Venue**: `venue_rating`, `nearby_hotels`, `nearby_dining`

---

### **3. Enrichment Process**

#### **Event Enrichment**:

* **Event Popularity**: Based on external reviews or internal data, the eventâ€™s popularity score can be calculated and updated dynamically.
* **Event Weather**: Include **weather forecasts** to enrich the event's details. This could be pulled from a weather API and dynamically added to the event.
* **Event Suggestions**: Recommend related events or activities near the venue, based on time or location.

#### **Venue Enrichment**:

* **Venue Rating**: Continuously updated with **attendee reviews** or **external review data** (e.g., TripAdvisor, Google Reviews).
* **Nearby Hotels**: Dynamically updated with the best-rated hotels near the venue.
* **Nearby Dining**: Add dining recommendations for the venue, which could be **enriched with user-generated content** or external data sources.

---

### **4. Content Generation for Events and Venues**

* **Content Templates**: We will use the enriched data to generate dynamic content such as **blog posts**, **web pages**, or **user-facing content**.

  * Example: A blog post for **Hampton Classic Horse Show** might include:

    * **Event Description**: Pulls directly from the **event\_description** field.
    * **Nearby Hotels**: Dynamically pulled from **venue\_enriched\_data** (such as `nearby_hotels`).
    * **Event Popularity**: Dynamically pulled from **event\_analysis**.
    * **Weather Forecast**: Dynamically pulled from **event\_weather**.

* **SEO**: Ensure SEO metadata is generated dynamically using enriched content, such as:

  * Title: `event_name`
  * Description: `event_description`
  * URL: `event_official_link`

---

### **5. Regular Enrichment Process**

The enrichment process will be **routinely updated** to ensure all event and venue data is up-to-date.

* **Triggers** for enrichment updates:

  * **Time-based triggers**: Event dates approaching, updates to weather data, hotel availability, etc.
  * **Manual enrichment**: Periodic review and enrichment of events and venues (e.g., adding more hotel options or local recommendations).
  * **API pulls**: External data sources like hotel APIs, review sites, and weather forecasts can be refreshed regularly.

---

### **6. Next Steps for Implementation**

1. **Review current data structure** in Airtable to ensure that fields are appropriately classified as **Base**, **Binder**, **Derived**, or **Enrichable**.
2. **Implement modular enrichment** for both **events** and **venues**, ensuring that enrichment data is linked correctly (e.g., `event_analysis_uids`, `venue_trending_uids`).
3. **Create content generation logic** based on enriched data, ensuring that **POV**, **Tone**, and **SEO** are properly applied.
4. **Set up refresh routines** to keep the enriched data current, including periodic checks for hotel reviews, event popularity, and weather data.

---

### **Conclusion**:

* **Enrichment** should be an ongoing process where **external data** (weather, reviews, nearby amenities) is dynamically linked to **events** and **venues**.
* **Routine enrichment** will ensure that your events and venues are **always updated**, without touching the **official data**.
