README/Changelog for Event & Content Agent System
Project Overview:

This platform is designed to aggregate, organize, and display event-related data for content creation. It uses an event agent that interacts with multiple data sources (e.g., events, venues, hotels, restaurants) to generate dynamic blog content or website pages. The system normalizes, references, and enriches data to ensure all content is up-to-date, relevant, and easily customizable.

Current Status (v0.1):
1. Core Components:

Proxy Server:

Serves as the central data access point for all agent queries, pulling data from GitHub (raw data files) and any other necessary endpoints.

Handles caching and provides real-time access to the structured datasets stored in GitHub.

Agent Structure:

A single agent designed to handle multiple types of queries about events, venues, hotels, and restaurants.

The agent reads from the manifest.json to determine paths, rules, and directories.

Event data, time-based queries, and location-based queries are processed based on the normalization rules.

Rules:

event-rules.json: Governs event structure and validation.

venue-rules.json: Defines how venue data should be structured and verified.

sources: Manages the source records that validate event or venue data (official sources like website URLs, social media, etc.).

2. Current Functionality:

Event & Venue Data:

The agent can retrieve event details (e.g., "What events are next?") and venue information (e.g., "Where is the Hampton Classic?").

It automatically applies filters based on time (e.g., events in January).

Source Handling:

The agent handles source data by referencing official sites and validating data (e.g., using the USEF event link or FEI official events).

Content Creation:

Once events and venues are gathered, the agent is capable of dynamically generating content (blog posts, webpages) for event-based queries.

POV & Tone logic is built to allow flexibility in how content is presented (e.g., confident, playful, or professional).

Needed for v1.0 (Next Milestones):
1. Agent Functionality:

Query Handling:

Extend agent functionality to handle queries like:

"How many events in January?"

"Whatâ€™s the weather like during the Hampton Classic?"

"Tell me the best places to eat near the venue."

Content Enrichment:

Add the ability to pull additional enriched data like:

Weather forecasts for event dates.

Venue recommendations (e.g., best places to stay near the venue).

Restaurant/dining recommendations based on the event's location.

2. Data Normalization:

Refine Time & Location Normalization:

Ensure all event dates, venues, and location data are normalized (consistent date format, address format).

Create proper location IDs (for cities, states, countries) and integrate them into event, venue, and stay data.

3. Sources & Verification:

Source Data:

Finalize the sources table to pull verified data for event content.

Ensure external sources are always used for official event verification and data validation.

Official vs. Non-Official Data:

The agent should check for official vs non-official sources and use them accordingly when generating content.

4. Content Generation:

Implement full content generation logic:

Use POV and Tone rules to generate tailored content (e.g., dynamic blog posts about events, venues, and places to stay).

Ensure SEO metadata is applied properly (title, description, canonical links).

Changelog (for Tracking Progress):
v0.1 (Current):

Established data structure (GitHub JSON files) and rules for event and venue data.

Built the core event agent capable of querying event data and retrieving related venue information.

Integrated proxy server to facilitate data access and caching.

Created foundational source management system for event validation.

Initial content generation structure in place, including POV and Tone rules.

v1.0 (Planned):

Full integration of time-based and location-based queries (e.g., events in a specific month, hotels near a venue).

Implement enriched content generation, including weather data, dining recommendations, and venue recommendations.

Expand source management to incorporate official and non-official sources dynamically.

Complete content generation for dynamic blog posts, pages, and SEO optimization.

Improve agent flexibility to handle different types of queries related to events, venues, and recommendations.

Important Notes:

Data Integrity: All data should be pulled from trusted sources or verified via official channels.

Rules Application: Each dataset must pass validation according to its rules (e.g., event UID must match a specific pattern, venue data must include location).

Enrichment: Content should be enriched with additional, relevant data (e.g., weather, nearby hotels, restaurants) for a richer user experience.

This document provides the foundation for v1.0 development and lays out a roadmap for expanding the platform to deliver more dynamic, contextually rich content. Next steps involve implementing the planned features for content enrichment, enhanced query handling, and source verification.
