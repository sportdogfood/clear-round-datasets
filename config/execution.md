Execution Steps 1) Identify the official event page and organizer; extract the official name and dates. 2) Identify venue details (address and coordinates) from official venue sources. 3) Airports → venue: provide drive minutes and note nonstop patterns using airport route maps/destination lists (cite airport pages). 4) Hotels (2–3): include distance/drive minutes, cancellation window, resort/destination fee, loyalty, parking, and any rig-parking note; cite each policy to a public source. 5) Dining: quick near venue, celebratory downtown, and breakfast/coffee; include distance/drive minutes, takeout/reservations facts, and cite official pages/menus. 6) Essentials: stabling, braiding, feed/bedding vendors and cutoffs, golf carts, vendor row, ring schedule; if not officially published, set null with a brief note. 7) Extras (tourism/operator pages): include hours/seasonality, distance/drive from venue, ticketing (required/reservation, adult/child pricing with currency), and parking details/fees. 8) Temps: use reputable climate sources (NOAA, Meteoblue, WeatherSpark) for event week; sunrise/sunset from timeanddate.com or equivalent. 9) Validate that every object has a publicly accessible source_url (one per object unless multiple are necessary). If any fact cannot be verified, set it to null and note why in meta.notes or the field’s note where applicable.
