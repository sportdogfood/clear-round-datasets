Research Rules - Prioritize official sources (event site, organizer/federation), then venue pages, then reputable news/press. Use operator/tourism sites for “extras.” - Confirm the organizer’s official event name styling and the official dates; capture any conflicts in meta.notes with citations. - Distances must be road distance in miles (one decimal) from the venue; drive times are typical, in minutes (integer). If you calculate using a mapping service, include the public share URL as the source. - Hotels/restaurants: focus on distance/drive time to venue, policies (cancellation window, resort/destination fee), loyalty program, and parking. No hype. - On-grounds logistics: if the venue/organizer doesn’t publish an item (e.g., braiding vendor), return null and a concise note (“no official braiding guidance published”). - Extras: use official operator/tourism pages; include hours/seasonality, distance/drive from venue, ticketing, and parking. - Citations required: every object must include a source_url. Use one URL per object unless multiple are necessary (then provide an array). - Dates: ISO YYYY-MM-DD. Times: 24-hour HH:MM local. Currency: include symbol if shown; else null. - Return only the JSON object below—no commentary.
