Absolutely, let's extend the Content rules to include Point of View (POV) and Tone.

Content (Full Structure) with POV & Tone

We'll align this with the goal of your platform—delivering targeted, dynamic, user-facing content with a clear brand voice and specific tone for each piece.

1. Content Rules with POV & Tone

POV (Point of View): Define the perspective that the content should take. For example, is it first-person, third-person, brand-authoritative, consumer-focused, etc.?

Examples:

First-Person (Brand POV): "We recommend these hotels because we know you’ll love them."

Third-Person (External POV): "Guests rated the Hampton Classic venue as one of the best."

Expert POV: "Experts agree this is one of the premier equestrian events."

Tone: Adjust the style and personality of the language to fit your brand, audience, and content purpose. Keep this tone consistent for all content creation to reinforce brand identity.

Examples:

Bold & Confident (Gritty): "Get ready for a week of excitement—only the strongest come out on top."

Playful & Fun: "Your dog will be wagging its tail with joy—fetch a meal from our top-rated spots!"

Professional & Informative: "The event takes place over 6 days, with top-tier competitors in action."

2. POV & Tone Logic Based on Content Type

The POV and Tone can change based on the content type and audience:

Event Content:

POV: Expert, Consumer, or Brand

Tone: Bold, Playful, Confident, Informative

Hotel Stays:

POV: Brand or Consumer (based on hotel recommendation)

Tone: Warm, Friendly, Assuring (for consumer), Authoritative (for brand)

Dining Recommendations:

POV: Brand (if recommending spots), Consumer (if user reviews are involved)

Tone: Fun, Playful (for restaurants), Refined (for high-end dining)

General Info (Weather, Location):

POV: Neutral, Informative (third-person)

Tone: Neutral, Clear, Helpful

3. Content Example with POV & Tone (Dynamic)

Here’s an expanded version of the blog post structure with POV and Tone elements integrated.
